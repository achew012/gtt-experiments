it\r represents a clear gesture of condemnation and dislike.\r \r    as long as a u.s. soldier violates the republic of panama, we will\r keep our ambassador here.  as long as the united states does not\r withdraw their troops and panama remains occupied, the panamanian and\r peruvian flags will remain together.\r \r    (reporter) don't you think that this attitude could harm certain\r relations with the united states;

 it is some sort of creditor\r bank created in 1946 that lends money to countries with\r balance-of-payments problems; that is, with problems with their\r foreign reserves levels.  when a country has no reserves or only $100\r million in reserves, it can apply for a credit from the imf to pay for\r imports or overdue debts.  this is the imf, an organization created to\r facilitate the flow of international financial resources.  an imf\r credit is dependent on signing a letter of intent or an adjustment\r program.  adjustment means reducing the country's internal consumption\r so as to spare the country's reserves in order to meet debt\r obligations.

(reporter) good morning, colonel.\r \r    (ochoa) good morning. thanks, raul.  these gentlemen seem to be\r speaking in the name of the entire armed forces.  i know well what was\r discussed in the meeting. someone even said that the bright idea of\r discharging me was considered.  they failed to take into account,\r however, that i am a deputy and that, as a deputy and a citizen, i am\r entitled to express what i feel, just as i have done.  i, who owe\r everything to the armed forces, who fought beside the soldiers as\r monterrosa, carlitos, and very few others did, never got rich when in\r the armed forces, as some of the commanders did, although not all of\r them, of course.  this undoubtedly has irritated them.\r \r    i have simply expressed my viewpoint as a soldier concerned about\r the armed forces' situation.  i never mentioned any names.  i simply\r demanded justice because, even according to military theory, i cannot\r conceive that such an important decision could have been made by a\r single person.  i still think this is a plot by some members of the\r institution, not by the armed forces as such.  i only have respect and\r love for the armed forces.  i am concerned over the delicate situation\r to which the institution could be led because of the actions of some\r nefarious members.  i have deep respect for the officers in the field,\r who fight every day.  of course, i must criticize those who have\r profited from the institution and who today have raised the roof, as\r if i were the one to blame and as if i were undermining the\r institutionality of the state.  quite the opposite is true.  my\r criticism is positive and intends to encourage a deeper investigation\r and exhaust all resources in this direction.  i would like them to\r stop making ridiculous demands and to stop seeking a confrontation.\r it is known that what i am demanding is what is being felt and said.\r i am not accusing anyone in particular.  i am only demanding justice.\r commanders' meetings should not be held to make such a statement.\r they should have instead shown their concern over the armed forces'\r situation.  i would have been very interested in seeing them take the\r stand to continue the investigation to the last consequences.  as the\r military man i am, i only assessed the situation.  i never mentioned\r any names, but insisted that a deeper inquiry should be made to carry\r out justice, because otherwise it is the institution that will suffer.\r \r    (reporter) col ochoa, after the \"sixty minutes\" program on cbs in\r the united states, it seems that in this capital and in the country\r your remarks and your interpretation of the jesuits' case were\r distorted.  today there has been an attempt to accuse you. it has been\r said that the cut in u.s. aid to the salvadoran armed forces is the\r result of your remarks, rather than of the slowness in the\r investigation of the jeusit priests' case.  do you think there has\r been ill intent in this, or that there has been an attempt to take\r advantage of you to try to justify an action?\r \r    (ochoa) i think so. there has been an attempt to blame me, as if i\r could influence the decision-making of the u.s. congress.  a reduction\r in military aid to el salvador has been under consideration for months\r because the expected results have not been obtained.  i think it is\r ridiculous and childish to say that the aid will be cut as the result\r of my remarks.  the truth is that all crimes with which some armed\r forces' members have jeopardized the institution should be punished.\r my understanding is that solidarity should exist in the context of\r operations and the fulfillment of the armed forces' constitutional\r mission.  however, those who harm the institution should not be\r protected.\r \r    i think some are trying to take advantage of the situation, as if\r to say: col ochoa has endangered the armed forces.  what has\r endangered the institution is the murder of the jesuits and the san\r sebastian people.  i canot agree with the perpetration of outrages.\r one thing is to fight fairly with the enemy.  there are dead in every\r war.  i said this very clearly when i was 4th infantry brigade\r commander in cabanas.  i agreed with the penetration into the\r population to help them.  i feel satisfied over my passage through the\r armed forces as a commander, because i identified myself both with my\r men and the civilian population.  at no time did i take advantage of\r the institution to acquire illegal riches.  to point these things out\r is not to attack the armed forces.  quite the contrary, it is because\r i love it that i have criticized the negative members.  the armed\r forces can thus be spared greater damage by the poor actions of some\r of its members.\r \r    (reporter) colonel, in the past few hours we have heard reports\r that you are to be supported by the army's younger officers and

{"docid": "TST2-MUC4-0006", "doctext": "dear radio audience: first of all, i want to\r thank you for allowing me to talk to you tonight about a very\r important issue for the future of our country.  many times you have\r heard us mention the word solidarity.  we have always used it as a\r word that means to think about those who suffer the most, those who\r have less.  indeed, those are the people we must help, even with our\r own sacrifice, and many times with a huge sacrifice by all of us.  if\r love is the bond that unites family members, solidarity should be the\r great pillar, the cement that unites salvadoran society, so that,\r united, we may fulfill our desire for peace, tranquility, happiness,\r and well-being.\r \r    however, tonight allow me to give you two examples of what we\r consider should be the use of the word solidarity and what this word\r means in matters that are completely different from one another.  a\r few weeks ago the government was forced, due to an increase in oil\r prices, to raise the price of oil byproducts such as gasoline, diesel,\r and all fuels.  in the past, the government subsidized gasoline.\r perhaps the government did this to make people believe this would have\r nothing but positive effects.  however, let us analyze for a while the\r issue of increases in the price of fuel.  when a government has no\r money for subsidizing, that means the cost of living will go up.\r there is no doubt that prices will rise when a government spends more\r than what it has.  however, let us see how this aspect, or rather the\r principle of solidarity, applies to the increase in fuel prices,\r especially the price of gasoline.\r \r    ten percent of all families in our country own a vehicle.  in\r general, that 10 percent are those who have the most; in other words,\r those who have the possibility of buying a car, a vehicle.  if we\r subsidized gasoline, what we would be doing is taking money out of a\r government that, for the time being, does not have such funds\r available.  in order to get such funds, the government would have to\r impose new taxes which would affect all salvadorans.  therefore, let\r us think whether or not it is fair that 90 percent of all salvadoran\r families, who own no vehicles, must pay some kind of tax in order to\r benefit the other 10 percent who have the resources that allow them to\r buy a vehicle.\r \r    we do not want to appear as demagogic or populist with this\r example.  what we want to say is that those of us who own a vehicle,\r who are part of the 10 percent lucky enough to have something and thus\r can buy a vehicle, must be in solidarity with that 90 percent who have\r little and many times nothing.  they have no vehicles, and therefore\r have no reason to suffer so the gasoline we buy becomes cheaper.\r moreover, to some extent the current price of gasoline makes it\r possible for the diesel supplied to urban and interurban bus companies\r to be bought at a price that will allow bus owners to maintain the\r current bus fares.  this is solidarity, and even more than that.\r those of us who have something, who own a vehicle, pay something --\r through the price of the gasoline we consume -- so that those who own\r nothing and must use the public transportation buses can do so with no\r price increase.\r \r    the same should be the case for the cost of liquid gas and propane\r gas, so that the prices of food cooked with gas in the marketplaces\r are not increased.  this is an example of how those of us who have\r something can show our solidarity with those who have little or\r nothing at all.\r \r    i would now like to talk about an example of an even deeper kind of\r solidarity.  i want to talk about peace.  salvadoran brothers, this is\r the time when we must show our solidarity with those mothers who have\r lost their sons.  we must show our solidarity with the innocent\r children who could kick a mine and end up without an arm or a leg.  we\r must show our solidarity with those who, because of violence, cannot\r find a job.  that is why this is the time for all of us to make an\r effort to achieve peace.\r \r    last thursday i told you i felt more optimistic after meeting with\r the political parties and listening to their decision to accept the\r challenge to work for peace.  they are determined to reach a consensus\r to fulfill the aspirations of all salvadorans.  we are beginning to\r sense what the near future of el salvador could be.  we are feeling\r happy and optimistic.  however, i repeat, this is the time when we\r should all contribute to peace.\r \r    anything that may lead to violence, whether it is street\r disturbances or bombs, should not be permitted, because it is no\r longer conceivable for mothers, children, and families to continue to\r suffer in our country.  the time has come to show our solidarity, to\r search, not only through words but also through our examples and\r actions, for the peace that our country and salvadorans deserve.\r \r    therefore, our solidarity should be the fundamental tool for our\r country's reconstruction.  it should be the fundamental tool for the\r physical and spiritual reconstruction of all salvadorans.  we want all\r salvadorans, without exception, to support the peace efforts, so that\r those who suffer so very much from violence will no longer suffer.\r \r    this is a fundamental step forward for the freedom and democracy of\r the salvadoran people.  salvadoran brothers, let us show our\r solidarity in this crucial time in our history, because we have always\r known that when all salvadorans act positively like brothers, we can\r come out ahead.  this is all for tonight.  thank you all very much and\r may god bless you.", "templates": []}

{"docid": "TST2-MUC4-0084", "doctext": "at the end of 1989 and at the beginning of 1990, the united\r states conducted two major military operations in latin america, to\r the unanimous condemnation of the nations of latin america and other\r parts of the world.  however, the fighters for \"freedom,\" \"democracy,\"\r and \"human rights\" in western nations have kept quiet out of fear of\r the naked aggression and the way of the tyrant.\r \r    on 20 december 1989, several tens of thousands of u.s.  troops,\r equipped with the most up-to-date weapons, brazenly intruded into\r panama, toppling the noriega government and forcing manuel antonio\r noriega to be tried in the united states.  this u.s. act was by no\r means less than the soviet act of invading czechoslovakia and\r kidnapping its leaders at that time.  the new panamanian government\r estimated that the u.s. invasion had resulted in the deaths of at\r least 600 panamanian soldiers and civilians and made several tens of\r thousands of people homeless.  more than 5,000 military and\r administrative personnel of the former government were arrested by\r u.s. troops, and panama suffered economic losses of $10 billion.  the\r united states openly manipulated the work of establishing a new\r panamanian government, national defense army, police force, and other\r state apparatuses, so much so that it rushed in and raided (as\r published) the embassies of other countries in panama or diplomatic\r apartments, and detained the diplomatic officials of other countries.\r under the powerful pressure of world opinion, some of the u.s. troops\r have withdrawn from panama, but the u.s.  government still refuses to\r pull out all its troops.\r \r    just after its intrusion into panama, the u.s. government\r immediately announced, as scheduled, the dispatch of a strong fleet of\r warships into the caribbean, close to the coast of colombia, for what\r was called an antidrug maneuver, intercepting planes and vessels for\r trafficking in drugs.  on 5 january this year, the united states,\r ignoring the strong opposition of latin american nations, ordered a\r fleet of four warships, including the aircraft carrier \"kennedy\" and\r nuclear-propelled cruiser \"virginia,\" to sail toward the caribbean to\r \"combat drug smuggling.\"  such a high-handed way of ignoring the\r sovereignty and will of latin american nations and forcing the\r deployment of troops in front of the gates of other countries evoked\r fierce reactions in colombia and other latin american nations.\r jaramillo ossa, a presidential candidate from the colombian patriotic\r union, noted that the united states \"very nearly\" invaded colombia.\r the colombian government also warned the u.s.  government: without the\r authorization of the government of president barco, no u.s warships\r are allowed to draw near (as published) the waters of colombia.  it\r also ordered its naval and air forces to intensify their sea patrols\r to safeguard the country's sovereignty.  at the same time, the\r governments of colombia, venezuela, and some other nations refused to\r join the proposed u.s. \"drug-fighting drill\" in the caribbean.  faced\r with such a situation, the bush administration had to order the\r \"drug-fighting fleet\" to return to base and cancel the \"drill.\"\r \r    on the aforementioned acts of the united states, leaders of some\r latin american nations commented: while relaxing the tension with the\r soviet union, the united states has reserved the \"right\" to interfere\r by force in latin america and other small and weak countries.  the\r public media of some nations solemnly pointed out: such moves of u.s.\r aggression are the continuation of the consistent u.s. policy of\r interfering in the affairs of latin america and also the extension of\r what is called the reagan doctrine, which started in the early 1980's.\r \r    in u.s. relations with latin america throughout the decade of the\r 1980's, there was a problem affecting the situation as a whole,\r namely, the issue of central america, which had all along been listed\r in the category of east-west confrontation by the united states.  the\r reagan administration even gave top priority to meeting the crisis in\r central america in its foreign policy.\r \r    in 1981, when reagan entered the white house, the situation in\r central america stood as follows: the sandinista revolution had won\r victory in nicaragua, the guerrilla war in el salvador was escalating,\r and a turbulent situation had started to emerge in other central\r american countries.  the human rights diplomacy pursued by the carter\r administration resulted in the deterioration of u.s. relations with a\r certain number of latin american nations ruled by juntas.  in 1977 the\r carter administration signed the panama canal treaty with the\r panamanian government, agreeing to return to panama sovereignty over\r the canal and the canal zone.  before the victory of the nicaragua\r revolution, in 1979 the carter administration abandoned its support\r for the tyrannical somosa regime and established normal relations with\r the sandinista regime.

(words indistinct)\r two-faced cristiani administration, the fmln has decided to immediately\r contact the dialogue observers and the church, which is the mediator, to\r demand through them guarantees for opposition civic and labor groups and a\r review of the current conditions of the dialogue, negotiation process, and\r its prospects.  meanwhile, we believe that it is necessary to suspend our\r participation in the caracas meeting.\r \r    (signed) fmln general command: commanders salvador sanchez ceren,\r francisco jovel, shafik jorge handal, eduardo sancho, and joaquin\r villalobos \r \r    el salvador, 2 november 1989",

(end recording)\r \r    the fmln described statements made by president-elect alfredo cristiani\r as irresponsible.  the president-elect immediately condemned the attack and\r attributed it to the urban commandos.  as a result of the attack, a\r 15-year-old girl was wounded and considerable damage was reported.  merino\r is currently out of the country.",

    "doctext": "san salvador\r domestic service in spanish at 0202 gmt on 21 july broadcasts a 1 hour\r and 11 minute live or recorded speech \"to the nation\" by salvadoran\r president alfredo cristiani on \"the current situation in the country\r and the national recovery plan.\"  no date or place is given.\r \r    cristiani begins by saying that this is his first report to the nation\r after 50 days as president.  he notes that since he assumed power on 1 june,\r the farabundo marti national liberation front has increased its level of\r violence and its number of \"indiscriminate killings.\"  he says that there is\r no reason for this since he expressed on 1 june his desire find a peaceful\r solution to the conflict in the country.\r \r    cristiani says that since 1 june he has repeatedly called for a peace\r dialogue, adding:  \"in order to begin a dialogue of this nature, it must be\r held in two phases:  naturally, during the first phase both sides must sit\r down to discuss the mechanisms to develop that dialogue process, a timetable\r for the talks, and the place where the talks will be held.  in other words,\r the first phase will be to determine how the dialogue process will take\r place.  the second phase -- once an agreement is reached on how the dialogue\r will be held -- is what will be discussed.  in that regard, our government\r has not set any conditions.  we are willing to discuss any topic, because we\r know that we must find solutions to many things, and we are willing to do\r so.  the only condition we have demanded for this dialogue process is that,\r once it begins, it should not be interrupted for any reason.  we believe\r that people want peace as soon as possible, and we cannot hold talks for\r years.  once we sit down to talk, that dialogue should continue until an\r overall solution is found to the conflict.  that is our government's\r position, and we maintain that position because we believe it is the most\r logical one.\"\r \r    turning to economic matters, cristiani says that the country needs to\r solve three problems:  the fiscal deficit, inflation, and unemployment.  he\r says that as a first step to begin the national economic recovery is to\r reform the government's pricing policy, adding:  \"we must protect low-income\r groups, and for this reason we have asked the economy minister to begin a\r process aimed at eliminating price controls.  we believe that we can\r eliminate price controls on 230 products without having a major impact on the\r majority of the public and that we can keep staple products under the\r control of the economy ministry.\"  he says that price controls on staples\r like basic grains, powdered milk, flour, coffee, sugar, vegetable oil and\r lard, cement for housing, and oil by-products will not be eliminated.\r \r    regarding the transportation sector, cristiani says: \"we agreed\r with the transportation sector to deregulate the differential service.\r to allow them to continue serving low-income segments of the\r population while charging current fares, we will also allow them to\r offer the higher-priced service.  in other words, people will be able\r to choose what kind of service they want to use: whether they continue\r to use the low-priced service or a better, more comfortable, and\r faster service.\"\r \r    on electricity rates, cristiani says: \"we feel that adjustments to\r electricity rates should be applied as a result of power that is wasted,\r that is, because it is power that is being consumed beyond what is needed to\r live normally.  the increase in electricity rates will be directly\r proportional to the consumption of energy in each home.  we believe that\r with this initial measure, the cel (lempa river hydroelectric\r executive commission) solve problems.\"\r \r    turning to other economic measures, cristiani says:  \"we have to take\r short-term measures too.  in this respect, the most logical step is to take\r measures that will affect consumption and not revenues. thus, we have asked\r the finance minister to take measures related to taxes.  he is to\r consolidate tax payments and only exempt the previously mentioned basic\r bread basket items from the present 5-percent tax.  we have to start\r eliminating tax exemptions.  only exports should have some type of monetary\r incentive because our country is interested in developing its exports.  the\r rest of the country's economic sectors should be taxed at the same rate.\"\r \r    cristiani adds:  \"we are going to modify the system of paying income\r tax.  we believe that the current system is based on unjust regulations, on\r revenues earned the previous year that do not reflect a firm's present\r situation.  thus, we are going to request that income-tax payments be based\r on a small percentage of the firm's present sales; these are a truer and\r more accurate reflection of a firm's income.\"\r \r    cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at\r increasing savings to promote domestic economic development.  he says that\r it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the\r country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country.\r regarding the country's currency, cristiani says:  \"we feel that currency\r value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign\r exchange.  we do not think it is appropriate for the government to\r arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the salvadoran colon.\r everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to\r pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 (colones) to\r 1 (dollar), the central banks still would not have enough foreign\r exchange to cover all the importers' demands.\"\r \r    further details as available.",

    "doctext": "1. during the years of dictatorship, chilean foreign relations were\r divided into two processes. on the one hand, as the dictatorship became\r more and more isolated, it was increasingly condemned in international\r fora and repudiated by international public opinion. on the other hand, as\r more and more countries and organizations expressed their support for a\r free chile and generously granted their solidarity to our cause, our\r organizations and democratic parties became increasingly open to the\r world. thus, they expanded their horizons and contributed their\r experiences.\r \r    2. during this period, the party has substantially strengthened its\r international relations and enhanced its vision of the international\r situation. it has strengthened its ties with the latin american peoples'\r revolutionary and democratic cause, and it has fully immersed itself in the\r great debates of world socialism. to these debates we brought our views on a\r profoundly renewed leftist socialism committed to democracy, development,\r and social change.\r \r    3. our relations with the parties that make up the international\r socialist (si) and with the si organization itself have been enriched within\r this context. this strengthening of ties has been the result of two things.\r first, it is based on the position that in compliance with its principles\r the si has upheld regarding the chilean situation. in october 1973, a few\r days after the coup, si chairman willy brandt condemned the end of the\r chilean democracy and president allende's assassination at the un general\r assembly. at the time he also said this was a great step backward for those\r who aspired to achieve socialism through democratic means. since then, the\r si has been permanently mobilized in favor of chile by making the chilean\r cause and salvador allende the symbols of all international struggle for\r democracy and change. it is within this framework of interest and\r cooperation that the voice of chilean socialism has been heard and our ideas\r and proposals praised.\r \r    4. the second reason stems from the process of expansion and\r transformation experienced by the si in the past 2 decades. the overall\r process of change that took place in the world during this period -- the\r technological revolution, the growing interdependence among nations,\r expansion of communications, global nuclear and military proliferation, the\r emergence of developing countries as international counterparts, the\r worsening of extreme poverty and international inequalities, the progress of\r liberation struggles in the third world, international awareness of the\r values of democracy and human rights -- has also effected major changes in\r the ideas and positions of socialist parties around the world. in this\r framework, the si has expanded its outlook, has increasingly renewed its\r ideas and, above all, has accepted pluralism within its fold as well as a\r broad internal debate about the best way to promote the cause of an\r autonomous, democratic socialism. it should be noted that this debate\r acquired a democratic, antifascist content as a result of the major role\r played by socialist forces that have engaged in a long antifascist struggle.\r (continued)",

    "doctext": "the most pressing demands of the\r chilean people have been brought up in the electoral campaign.  one of\r the most important achievements of this campaign has been the\r combining of the campaign with the just economic, political, and\r social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement\r have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship.  these demands\r are related to the struggle against repression, the defense of human\r rights, the denunciation of crimes committed by the regime, and\r efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding\r torture, disappearances, and assassinations. these questions have once\r again come into the spotlight now that many rightist candidates are\r demagogically attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and\r since el mercurio has reported that the dictator is planning to\r convert the cni (national information center) into an agency of the\r army so that the main repressive body from all these years can be\r under his direct control.  jaime inzunza, leader of the united left\r and the communist party of chile, discusses these topics over a direct\r phone line from santiago, chile.\r \r    (begin recording) (announcer) how are the chilean people's demands\r connected to the ongoing electoral campaign?\r \r    (inzunza) they are connected through the democratization of the\r neighborhood boards during the electoral process; the strengthening of\r the unified actions of workers; the development of the committees for\r victory, which will also be committees for the defense of victory and\r committees for carrying on the democratic task; the development of\r confidence; the struggle for human rights, particularly concerning\r truth and justice and immunity for crimes; the increasing pressure by\r the immense majority of the population for the release of all\r political prisoners; and naturally for the dissolution of the cni.\r all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign,\r and agreements have been reached within social organizations.  this\r was evidenced a week ago by the salvadora strike and by the current\r strike by coal miners.  this proves that the people have understood\r that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their\r activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the\r future struggle. (end recording)\r \r    the preceding comments were made by communist party of chile leader\r jaime inzunza, who has been interviewed over the telephone on our\r program \"escucha chile.\"  another topic discussed by inzunza was the\r el mercurio report on the cni's transfer to the army.  the dissolution\r of the cni has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense\r majority of chileans.\r \r    (begin recording) (announcer) what is your opinion, jaime inzunza,\r on the dictator's intention to maintain the cni as it is and to keep\r it under his direct command?\r \r    (inzunza) i believe that this issue is particularly serious.  the\r intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the\r dictatorship, which has been responsible for the most flagrant\r violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence.  i\r understand that the dina (national intelligence directorate, replaced\r by cni) and the cni have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore\r the main organs of state terrorrism over the past 15 years.  if\r transferred to the army, the cni would continue to be under pinochet's\r orders.  under whose orders has it been all these years?  for whom has\r it been a direct agent all these years?  henceforth it will be under\r the control of the office of the commander in chief of the army. (end\r recording)\r \r    communist leader jaime inzunza added that pinochet's intent in\r transferring the cni to the army's direct command is to make the\r institution an accomplice in concealing people who have been\r responsible for crimes and human rights violations.\r \r    (begin recording) (inzunza) the idea is to involve the military\r institution in crimes for which the chilean people knows it was not\r responsible.  this is clear: what the democratic opposition forces\r want is to have the culprits behind those crimes and human rights\r violations prosecuted, not the military institution.  the transfer of\r the cni to the army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as\r accomplices or accessories to those crimes.  loyalty is not at stake\r here; loyalty is defending values and principles, not some sort of\r criminal complicity that is not in line with the training of these\r men.  this seems to me to be particularly serious because this\r transfer implies maintaining the cni under the orders of the man\r responsible for the crimes committed all these years, the dictator\r himself. (end recording)\r \r    these have been answers given by jaime inzunza, united left and\r communist party of chile leader, to questions put to him over the\r phone by \"escucha chile,\" a radio moscow international program.",

    "doctext": "...that the fmln (farabundo\r marti national liberation front) launched against the salvadoran\r people on 11 november.  the fmln launched this aggression with all of\r its forces, chiefly using a concentration of weapons and fighters in\r the san salvador metropolitan zone, in zacatecoluca, la paz\r department, and at times in usulutan city, usulutan deparment, and in\r san miguel city, san miguel department.  in this aggression the fmln\r displayed its weaponry.  it displayed an incredible amount of weapons,\r which....(changes thought) by the way, in recent days the salvadoran\r armed forces have begun a number of searches in some houses where it\r is believed that some of these weapons were located. we have already\r found large amounts of weapons.\r \r    in addition, the fmln launched an aggression and hid behind you,\r salvadoran people.  it used you as a shield, wanting to convey the\r idea that they have the support of the salvadoran people and that the\r people here would rise up to support them.  they have realized that\r this view is totally false.  far from supporting the fmln, the\r salvadoran people, salvadoran brothers, supported the armed forces in\r the tremendous effort it has conducted to repel the fmln aggression.\r \r    however, we must now consider a very important matter.  it is\r impossible to carry out an aggression of this size without support\r from someone abroad.  on this occasion, we are certain that this\r support came from nicaraguan president ortega and cuban president\r castro, but chiefly from ortega who is trying to raise a smokescreen\r in the face of the real possibility that mrs violetta chamorro may\r defeat him in the elections, and because the fmln has always been the\r puppet of the international communist aggression in which ortega and\r castro participate.  if this is not so, let us take a look at what has\r happened.  during those times when you were suffering moments of\r anguish last week, you were able to see the large number of foreigners\r who were supporting the fmln terrorists.  we have also managed to\r collect evidence that the ortega government trained fmln fighters in\r the use of certain kinds of weaponry, specifically the grenade\r launchers.\r \r    what happened?  in the past few weeks we began noticing what kind\r of weapons were being used.  in the foiled attack on the presidential\r house, a subsequent attack on the salvadoran armed forces' joint\r chiefs of staff, and lastly, an attack on the national guard garrison\r particular kinds of weapons were being used.  as a result of the\r savage action by fmln, two little girls were killed.  moreover, let us\r recall and see the connection that exists with all the shipments that\r the salvadoran armed forces have been stopping between nicaraguan and\r el salvador.  one shipment was made prior to the visit we presidents\r made to costa rica.  in that country, we denounced ortega for\r continuing to send weapons and supporting the fmln in an open\r violation of the central american peace process.\r \r    and what has happened lately?  on 25 november, salvadoran people,\r two light airplanes coming from nicaragua were discovered.  their\r flight course indicates that they came from nicaragua, especially the\r one where the weapons were found.  as additional proof, we have a\r document showing that one light aircraft belongs to the seta\r transportation company located in nicaragua's augusto cesar sandino\r airport.  it was bringing sophisticated equipment for the fmln.  in\r that aircraft accident, four people were killed: the pilot who was\r wearing civilian clothes and three other people were wearing military\r uniforms; i mean camouflage uniforms like the ones worn in many\r countries, and like the ones the salvadoran armed force use.  it is\r believed that two of those people died as a result of the accident.\r we also believe that another person killed himself because he had a\r weapon in his hand and a bullet wound in forehead.  he killed himself\r because he saw himself implicated in this situation.

    "doctext": "comrades: a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at\r the conclusion of the central american presidents' emergency meeting.\r let us see first why the meeting took place.  the main reason is the\r very complicated predicament in which our offensive has placed\r cristiani and the high command.  as you will remember, the government\r has met with much international disrepute and isolation because of the\r brutal assassination of jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian\r population.  let us recall, as a significant fact, that the united\r nations has condemned the government because of all it has done,\r especially because of the latest atrocities.  on that occasion, el\r salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while\r 96 countries voted in favor.\r \r    we mention this case as a most significant one, but the fact is\r that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the\r dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation.  this\r was a cause of concern for the north americans.\r \r    to whom could they turn at a time when all international\r organizations had turned their backs on cristiani?  the north\r americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the\r genocidal regime and that, on the contrary, would provide support in\r spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed.\r \r    the most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of\r central american presidents, because in central america, as we all\r know, the north americans have had their backyard and most of these\r countries serve their interests.\r \r    the meeting was called to try to pull cristiani out of\r international isolation.\r \r    under what conditions did summit take place?  we have to say first\r that the presidents of el salvador and costa rica, and probably of\r guatemala, had reached an agreement prior to the meeting.  the subject\r of the discussion was a document drafted by arias and cerezo.  this\r document expressed support for cristiani from the very beginning.\r joseph sullivan, a u.s. state department official in charge of latin\r american affairs, as well as other u.s.  state department officials,\r were present at the meeting.  the costa rican ambassador to nicaragua\r -- a pro-u.s. man who introduced the nicaraguan contras at the meeting\r -- was also present, conspiring all the time.  the fmln was not even\r allowed to enter costa rica.\r \r    however, in spite of the fact that the meeting had been fixed and\r in spite of the u.s. presence, the agreement to support cristiani was\r achieved almost at the price of killing the esquipulas agreement.  it\r was not easy.  the u.s. will to condemn the fmln and to back cristiani\r prevailed in the midst of much bickering and the insolence of the\r honduran president.\r \r    as you can see, it was not easy to find support for the genocidal\r regime even in places where the north americans think they have the\r bull by the horns.\r \r    let us see, as a third point, in what the declaration consists.\r (continued)",

    "doctext": "good afternoon, we\r have just received a statement issued by president virgilio barco vargas\r concerning the murder of mr.  carlos pizarro leongomez.  the message reads as\r follows:\r \r    carlos pizarro's murder is a monstrous crime that has cut short the\r life of a man who had shown his will for peace and his commitment to\r colombia.  the crime was directed at hindering the development of the\r electoral process and destroying the reconciliation process that the\r government and m-19 (19 april movement) carefully constructed,\r surpassing many obstacles.  in this case, as in many others, this\r painful tragedy should serve to consolidate the ideals of peace and\r pluralism for which so many colombians have struggled -- one of them,\r carlos pizarro.  it should serve to reassert our repudiation of\r violence and our faith in democratic procedures.\r \r    further on the president's message notes:\r \r    pizarro's relatives and his followers know that the government, and\r i personally, feel strong wrath and sadness, but we will not be\r discouraged.  we will uphold the banners of reconciliation, pluralism,\r and the right to freely and peacefully express any idea.  we will also\r continue to unmask and combat enemies of peace.\r \r    the president adds in his message:\r \r    i interpret the desire of all colombians who admired carlos\r pizarro's democratic vocation, by warning those who are responsible\r for this tragic murder that they will not manage to destroy what has\r been worked for so hard and with the support of political forces and\r the people who voted for peace on 11 march to open a road for peace\r that is clear, possible, and defined.\r \r    the president's message continues:\r \r    you know that during this peace process, many enemies and\r difficulties were surpassed, but none has been so large as this\r tragedy that has shaken all colombians.  the obligation that lies\r before us is to keep open the road to peace that the murderers of\r carlos pizarro want to destroy.  article 95 of the electoral code\r indicates that when a presidential candidate dies, another person in\r his own movement has the right to take his place.  in compliance with\r this norm, the government will offer every facility for the registry\r of a new m-19 presidential candidate, so that he can continue to hoist\r the flags of peace and pluralism as is proper for a democratic debate.\r \r    the president also says in his message:\r \r    i have asked the government minister and the peace adviser to meet\r as soon as possible with m-19 representatives so that together they\r may study alternatives to confront such a serious situation. as soon\r as possible, the government minister will also direct contacts with\r the rest of the political forces to request their opinions about the\r present situation and to continue to give all the necessary guarantees\r so that the electoral process may develop according to what is\r established in the constitution and our laws.\r \r    the message ends:\r \r    i invite all colombians who are tired of so much violence to come\r to the polls in the next elections and vote for peace and pluralism.\r i invite all political and social forces to join in solidarity with\r the electoral process and defend the institutions that are threatened\r by violence.  it is time for good sense and prudence.  it is time to\r rise to the occasion and show our commitment to democracy.\r \r    this is the text of president virgilio barco's message on the\r murder mr. carlos pizarro leongomez.",

(end\r recording)\r \r    the president spoke today at the el salvador military airport\r before he left for costa rica to attend the inauguration ceremony of\r president-elect rafael calderon fournier.  he also said that the\r united states conditioning 50 percent of the aid given to our country\r could cause the rebel front to increase their actions.  he accused the\r fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) of using dialogue for\r tactical reasons.\r \r    (begin recording) (cristiani) we have stated that an action of this\r type would be very untimely, as it could make the most radical fmln\r members decide to continue the war and, thus, hinder the dialogue\r process.\r \r    (reporter) however, (words indistinct) pressure government for them\r (words indistinct) with fmln.\r \r    (cristiani) i would ask the question: who has always showed\r goodwill and sincerely sought an agreement and who has not done this?\r history shows that in the past, the fmln has used the proposals by\r (jose napoleon) duarte's government and my own for tactical reasons.\r it has not been the governments.  i believe that the fmln must\r understand and be pressured to really search for a political solution.\r (end recording)\r \r    also today, the un secretary general authorized a spokesman to\r announce that talks between the government and fmln will be renewed on\r 16 may.  the panorama that surrounds this new encounter, however,\r presents an entirely different pattern from meetings in the past,\r because both sectors have met with political parties represented at\r the (word indistinct).  furthermore, although the government has not\r done the same with the country's social forces, the rebels will try to\r do so this week.  undoubtedly, the results that could be obtained from\r the dialogue could be much more important than those obtained during\r past negotiations, because almost all the sectors that have become\r involved, directly or indirectly, in the negotiating demand that the\r agreements attained be based on internal cooperation.",

to convince\r foreign revolutionary movements that dealt with noriega, such as the\r fmln and the m-19, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime\r was unsustainable; and to move the anti-noriega sector within the fdp\r to support specific actions against noriega's regime.\r \r    the fdp members, officers, and troops were the targets of this\r plan.  we see how some were taken in by the psychological operations\r plan.  the targets of this plan were gen noriega, noriega's panamanian\r collaborators within the fdp, some civilians, foreign governments that\r are noriega's allies, foreign governments that are hostile to noriega,\r and foreign revolutionary organizations that deal with noriega. they\r identified all of noriega's vulnerabilities, as well as the\r vulnerabilities of all the targets we have already mentioned.\r \r    there were certain themes used in these psychological operations,\r and the media fell for them many times. this is why we repeatedly\r asked them not to fall for this misinformation.\r \r    these themes included: by imposing his arbitrary nature and\r corruption, noriega is perverting the fdp and promoting the\r disintegration of that military institution.  the fdp have become a\r mafia that is heading toward disgrace. this is a topic that has been\r discussed in leaflets and many publications.\r \r    by disrupting the constitutional order at his whim, noriega is\r provoking a profound social, economic, and political crisis that is\r ruining the country. this is done to hide those who are truly\r responsible for the crisis we are experiencing. the longer noriega\r remains in power, the more probable becomes a u.s., cuban, or soviet\r intervention.  the domestic and international conflicts provoked by\r noriega negatively affect the personal well-being of the fdp members\r and their families.\r \r    noriega's fall is inevitable and the fdp should not fall with him.\r to save the fdp and the republic of panama, the fdp must remove\r noriega from office. this is why there were siren songs that an\r internal coup was under way.\r \r    the state security organizations have been following this case for\r 5 months and we know the fugitives are in the united states. we know\r where they left from. no one can deny the association of certain u.s.\r citizens who are involved in this operation with the panamanian groups\r that were captured.\r \r    we have the evidence, the weapons, the instruments used for\r misinformation, the plans, and the maps with the targets for violence.\r important people who were going to be kidnapped had also been marked\r on these maps. they had marked the bridges that were to be destroyed.\r \r    gentlemen, we know the power of weapons and we know how to use\r them.  we know the damage they can do. therefore, before there was a\r violent confrontation between the panamanian people and their fdp, we\r went one step ahead of their plans. if arrests were made, it was\r because we wanted to avoid a confrontation with inexperienced groups\r that allowed themselves to be used for the personal benefit of those\r who received, with a siren song, the promise of the panamanian\r people's $30 million that eric arturo delvalle was going to use for\r subversive acts, bloody acts to bathe our people in blood, as in the\r case of the struggle of our brother countries in latin and central\r america.\r \r    we will not permit that. that is why we decided to go one step\r ahead and foil these plans that have a certain purpose and that would\r result in mourning and pain for panamanian families.\r \r    we have the evidence and those who were arrested were damn well\r arrested: alberto conte, fred boyd, and all those people who have been\r working behind the scenes so eduardo herrera and friends can live like\r kings in the united statets, so they can live their lives drinking\r champagne and eating pheasant.\r \r    eduardo herrera was dismissed from a diplomatic post for smuggling\r 40 boxes of whiskey per week into israel.  he is the kind of person\r protected by the pentagon and elliott abrams. he is elliott abrams'\r hero.\r \r    theresa wellington of the (u.s.) embassy in mexico, who gave these\r people--who left panama for mexico-- their visas in 10 minutes by\r abrams' orders, has also become one of our people's enemies.

(end recording) (passage omitted)\r \r    while still on the subject, ecopetrol's president, who traveled\r this morning to barrancabermeja to attend a forum on the magdalena\r river, reported that, so far this year, terrorist attacks have cost\r his company $300 million.  we have this report from maria clara\r gracia.\r \r    (begin recording) (gracia) ecopetrol has lost 95 billion pesos in\r revenues this year due to the 44 terrorist attacks on the cano limon -\r covenas oil pipeline. in these attacks, 13.2 million barrels of crude\r oil have been lost. the areas most affected by these attacks are in\r sucre, arauca, norte de santander, and santander departments.\r \r    (reporter alvaro ayala) doctor, could these terrorist attacks lead\r to an increase in fuel prices in colombia?\r \r    (dr andres restrepo londono, president of ecopetrol) obviously,\r there will come a time when, faced with increasing internal production\r costs and falling revenues, we are going to have to consider\r compensating our losses with an increase in domestic oil prices, but\r that is a measure we are not about to adopt at this time.\r \r    (gracia) today's landslide, which destroyed a section of the\r multipurpose pipeline between barrancabermeja and bucaramanga, has\r resulted in estimated losses totalling 1.435 billion pesos.

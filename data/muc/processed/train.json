 time and the spirit of the times are\r obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador.  while peoples\r of the world tear down dogmas, dictatorships, and walls, bustillo, who\r leaves through the door of defeat, asks the armed forces to be tougher,\r commit more genocide, and build more walls of repression against the church,\r the people, and the nation as a whole.  goodbye, gen. bustillo.  we continue\r writing history without you.  the decade we begin is of democracy,\r independence, and self-determination.  that is why foreign intervention and\r the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country, where the\r people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by\r bombings.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "attack", "Location": [[["el salvador", 1225]]], "PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [[["air force", 9]]], "PhysicalTarget": [], "Weapon": [], "HumTargetCivilian": [[["salvadorans", 1599]], [["arnulfo romero", 1623]], [["jesuit priests", 1646]]], "HumTargetGovOfficial": [], "HumTargetMilitary": [], "HumTargetPoliticalFigure": [], "HumTargetLegal": [], "HumTargetOthers": [], "KIASingle": [[["arnulfo romero", 1623]]], "KIAPlural": [[["jesuit priests", 1646]]], "KIAMultiple": [], "WIASingle": [], "WIAPlural": [], "WIAMultiple": []}]}

explosions and shooting heard throughout the early hours in san\r salvador were no longer heard after 1000 (1600 gmt).  \r \r    however, attacks against vehicles and clashes between the guerrillas and\r the army continue to be reported in various parts of country's interior.\r \r    the guerrillas continue to boycott the elections with a blockade of all\r land transportation, but they have

among the electors, both in the capital and in neighboring\r towns, are many members of the main opposition party, the rightist\r nationalist republican alliance (arena), who are carrying banners and other\r visible signs of their party preference.\r \r    surveys have shown arena's candidate, alfredo cristiani, will almost\r certainly win the elections.\r \r    acan-efe correspondents who toured

to leave them more than 200 meters\r away.\r \r    in apopa, a town some 12 km north of san salvador, the voting booths\r opened very late, because their location was changed at the last minute,\r which generated protests from the delegates of several parties and led to\r brawls between arena and pdc supporters.\r \r    in the early morning, military helicopters used flares several times to\r light up apopa and its environs, presumably to locate guerrillas.\r \r    members of the democratic convergence, an alliance of leftist parties,\r said in apopa they have received death threats to dissuade them from voting.\r \r    in the small town of tonacatepeque, some 16 km northeast of san salvador,\r the delay in beginning the voting was only half an hour long, and the\r election process is proceeding normally.\r \r     in san ramon, another town close to the capital with 30,000 inhabitants,\r the voting began after a considerable dealy because of a guerrilla incursion\r in the dawn hours.\r \r    army helicopters fired rockets for several hours at the slopes of san\r salvador volcano, in the northern part of the capital, presumably at the\r guerrilla columns that attacked san

 \r \r    (cepeda) in colombia the dirty war stemming from the american tactics of\r so-called low-intensity conflict is intensifying.  the internal political\r crisis is deepened by an alliance between the powerful drug smuggling clans\r and the military leadership which is conducting the dirty war.  in the santa\r fe ii document, formulating future united states policy in latin america, it\r is even said that unless the united states intervenes in the 1990's colombia\r will become another el salvador and on a much larger scale.  the so-called\r extermination operation, also known as the condor plan, is directed against\r the communist party and up, against the unions, but also against priests who\r preach liberation theology, and recently this has intensified.  in colombia\r some elements of fascism openly manifest themselves.  this is manifested in\r huge and unpunished massacres and in the powerlessness of president barco\r and his civilian ministers who are not managing to keep the military\r leadership in check, although the president is the supreme commander of the\r armed forces.\r \r    (posledni) sometimes partisans are also accused of terror.  \r \r    (cepeda) that is one of the traits of american policy -- to term any\r kind of revolutionary struggle, of struggle for democracy, and the\r people's movement as terrorism.  therefore, it also labels the sandinistas\r in nicaragua as terrorists and the contra rebels as freedom fighters.  by\r this i do not want to say that the partisans do not make mistakes, we also\r criticize them.  for example, we condemned the destruction of oil piplines\r by the colombian partisan organization the national liberation army (eln).\r we do not agree with kidnapping civilians in exchange for ransom.  we\r announced that, as long as it is impossible to end the conflict, it is\r necessary to humanize it and to respect human lives.  these are the tactics\r of soldiers -- to label the partisans as terrorists and then massacre the\r civilian population as suspects who are collaborating with terrorism.\r \r    (posledni) partisans from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia\r (farc) offered the government a dialogue about a truce.  how do they want to\r conduct this?\r \r    (cepeda) the farc, which is the strongest element of the colombian\r partisan movement and a member of its coordinating committee, unilaterally\r adopted a cease-fire and proposed the creation of a commission for this\r dialogue.  in it are two former presidents, the liberal lopez michelsen and\r the conservative pastrana, the chairman of the association of industrialists\r echeverri correa, and bogota's cardinal rebollo.  the farc wants the\r government to disband the paramilitary groups.  the former interior minister,\r gaviria, said that there are 140 of them.  this means that the government\r knows them.  the farc is demanding the purge of people from the army command\r involved in the dirty war, that the defense minister be a civilian, that the\r state of emergency be revoked, and that the road to real democracy be opened.\r \r    (posledni) but the government has begun negotiating with partisans from\r m-19.\r \r    (cepeda) the el tiempo newspaper reported that the government promised\r them representation in parliament by their inclusion as candidates of the\r liberal party.  this is to involve four seats as long as m-19 lays down its\r arms and disbands.  the other partisans bitterly criticized this as a blow\r against the unity of the movement which will be abused for propaganda\r purposes.  at the same time, m-19 represents only 5 percent of the\r movement.  it is the intention of the government to divide the partisans.\r \r    (posledni) the colombian communist party congress took place in\r december.  how did it react to the situation?\r \r    (cepeda) the party called for peace and outlined the struggle for a\r pluralist government of transition towards peace and democracy.  at the end\r of february there was a central committee session which discussed the dirty\r war.  it stated that, in spite of the terror, there had not been what had\r happened in similar situations in other latin american countries, namely,\r mass emigration.  to ensure that this does not happen in the future, the\r central committee discussed new measures, including the transition of part\r of the party to the underground.  we will not all transfer, because now we\r must struggle for open contact with the masses, regardless of the huge risk\r which is linked to this.\r \r    (posledni) where is the party seeking allies?  \r \r    (cepeda) comrade antequera, as deputy chairman of the up, had established\r a number of contacts.  however, he was murdered, and senator samper pisano,\r a politician from the ruling liberal party, was seriously injured during the\r assassination at bogota airport on 3 march.  the assassination attempt\r against the 32-year-old prospective politician occurred the day after he\r announced his candidacy for the presidency.  he announced his support for\r democratic coexistence, for an end to the dirty war which, as he said, is\r not in the interest of the colombian people.  therefore, he was not a chance\r victim.  it is also significant that the closed circuit television covering\r the airport, which is in the hands of the army, was switched off.  thus,\r they wanted to prevent the murderers being filmed.  one of them died, they\r let the other three escape.  at the same time, bogota's chief of police was\r at the airport along with another 10 colonels and a number of policemen and\r personal bodyguards.\r \r    (posledni) how did the other parties react to the assassination?\r \r    (cepeda) a joint document was signed by the colombian communist \r party, the up, and the liberal party, on whose behalf the former president\r turbay ayala signed.  it demands that the government disband the\r paramilitary squads.  it shows that opinions are beginning to differ, even\r in the ruling liberal party.  the conservatives are also emphatically\r criticizing the bloodbath and the passivity of the government, pointing out\r that their last president, betancur, conducted a dialogue with the\r partisans.  this is all happening before the elections which will take place\r next year.\r \r    (posledni) the colombian communist party leadership met with the\r president after the murder of comrade forero.  what was that about?\r \r    (cepeda) in the conversation, we pointed to the fact that the defense\r minister, general guerrero paz, travels around colombia accompanied by the\r leader of the ultra-right wing, retired general landazabal reyes, who is\r leader of the paramilitary groups.  we asked why these two are together.\r the president did not answer us.  at the meeting we also said that, unless\r the dirty war stops, the colombian communist party for the first time in\r history will not take part in the elections.  we will not be able to\r participate, because we are all being murdered.  unless the government gives\r us a guarantee of security, we will not sacrifice more lives.\r \r    (posledni) thank you for the interview.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "attack", "Location": [[["colombia", 47]]], "PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "PhysicalTarget": [], "Weapon": [], "HumTargetCivilian": [], "HumTargetGovOfficial": [], "HumTargetMilitary": [], "HumTargetPoliticalFigure": [[["forero", 351]], [["sotelo", 359]]], "HumTargetLegal": [], "HumTargetOthers": [], "KIASingle": [[["forero", 351]], [["sotelo", 359]]], "KIAPlural": [], "KIAMultiple": [], "WIASingle": [], "WIAPlural": [], "WIAMultiple": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "Location": [[["colombia", 47], ["bogota", 3028]]], "PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "PhysicalTarget": [], "Weapon": [], "HumTargetCivilian": [], "HumTargetGovOfficial": [[["samper pisano", 5088]]], "HumTargetMilitary": [], "HumTargetPoliticalFigure": [[["antequera", 371]]], "HumTargetLegal": [], "HumTargetOthers": [], "KIASingle": [[["antequera", 371]]], "KIAPlural": [], "KIAMultiple": [], "WIASingle": [[["samper pisano", 5088]]], "WIAPlural": [], "WIAMultiple": []}]}

(changes thought).  instead, i should say that\r they went to have some fun at the dilido discoteque. our military police\r patrols were in the area and saw the attack.  we captured two suspects.  our\r men were about 100 meters away when the attack occurred, and, unfortunately,\r the two suspects are u.s.  citizens.  in other words, people were in the\r area and no one knew what they were doing.  this is an official report; this\r is what took place in la ceiba.  the two suspects were arrested, and they\r must know something about the seven who were wounded, who are at the (word\r indistinct) hospital.  what you reported over the radio is correct.  there\r is no need to be alarmed.  it was a homemade bomb, and the damage was caused\r by the shrapnel, cement, and stones that were thrown into the air by the\r explosion.  \r \r    however, i would like to deny a report by the milkman from (word\r indistinct), who said that the city has been shut down and is being held\r hostage.  that is not true.  when the incident occurred, (words indistinct)\r the patrols were already on the streets and reported the incident.  fusep\r (the public security force) was instructed to conduct investigations, and\r therefore vehicles entering or leaving la ceiba were stopped and searched.\r that is all;

there\r were people on that bus, and i myself allowed them to continue.  i am\r sorry that the chamber of commerce has been misinformed.  we are not\r paralyzing activities, nor are we holding the city hostage.  as i said, we\r are trying to conduct an investigation and we have arrested two people.\r we are not sure if they were the ones who perpetrated the attack;

i want to made this clear.\r \r    (reporter) yes, of course.  colonel, given the situation, do you believe\r that the situation in the armed forces is completely normal?\r \r    (sanchez) of course it is completely normal.  we are not restricting\r anyone's freedom.  when it gets dark, we will proceed to ask for\r identification papers; we will stop and check vehicles, which is normal in\r this type of situation.  however, at no time will we paralyze production or\r normal daily activities.  we are trying to find the culprits responsible for\r this attack.  regardless of whether it was an attack against u.s.  citizens,\r it was certainly an attack against peace and order.  we therefore have to\r investigate it, regardless of whether or not it involved u.s.  citizens.  in\r this case, and in view of this situation, i personally issued orders and\r followed the investigation until 0500, when i suspended all operations.  i\r personally ordered these measures.  i am amazed that the cattlemen do not\r transport milk before 0500.\r \r    (reporter) one last question on this matter:  is the situation in la\r ceiba related to the latest violent incidents in san pedro sula?\r \r    (sanchez) i believe so.  a series of criminal actions has been launched\r against social peace in honduras.  this station's listeners and listeners of\r all other honduran radio stations know the high - caliber of the armed\r forces personnel, beginning with the top commanders and continuing with\r officers down the chain of command.  we are sensitive to social isses and\r are not motivated by vested interests of any kind.  i believe that these\r acts of bloodshed, which are (words indistinct), are part of a series of\r fully planned, coldly calulated actions.\r \r    i do not want to sound like a comic strip character, but i believe that\r these actions are connected and overlap.  i have the impression that (words\r indistinct).  we are witnessing the emergence of the so-called white hands\r and black hands (death squads), which concern us very much.  we are\r talking about hondurans killing hondurans.  \r \r    (reporter) thank you very much for your kindness to this station.  we\r will be contacting you during the next few hours to learn the results of the\r investigations into this homemade bomb attack in la ceiba.\r \r    (sanchez) we are completely at your service.  we are willing to offer you\r information as it comes in.  we are a completely open, not closed,\r organization.  we will give you truthful, factual information for the\r benefit of all hondurans.  \r \r    (reporter) thank you and good morning, colonel.", "templates": []}

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0313", "doctext": "good evening ladies and gentlemen.  today we will\r discuss the foreign debt problem.  this subject could perhaps seem a\r bit out place at a time when more troublesome matters affect all\r argentine families, such as high public utility rates, prices,\r controls, difficulties, etc.  however, we must attend to the foreign\r debt problem because most our difficulties come from it.\r \r    of what does this problem consist?  we currently owe $64 billion.  this\r represents a burden of $6 billion yearly in interest payments.  since\r argentina is currently exporting $9 billion annually, and if we paid $6\r billion in interest, we would only have $3 billion left annually to attend\r to all our national needs, that is, the needs of industry, commerce, etc.\r \r    obviously this is not enough money, and we cannot pay $6 billion in\r interest each year with $9 billion worth of annual exports.\r \r    this is not new.  this is a heavy inheritance, which originated not in\r the recent past but more than 10 years ago.  when martinez de hoz became\r economy minister (march 1976), the foreign debt amounted to $9 billion.\r when he concluded his term, the debt amounted to $29 billion.  the\r military governments that came after him dragged the debt along and\r increased it to $44 billion which they passed to president alfonsin.\r alfonsin's administration increased the debt by an additional $20 billion.\r so today our debt amounts to $64 billion.\r \r    this is not all.  we ceased honoring our commitments abroad.  we have not\r even paid interest since april last year.  we have only made token\r payments.  this refutes the ideas of those who say: let us stop paying our\r debt and use the resources to make the country grow.  we are not paying\r anything.\r \r    for more than a year we have not been paying anything, and not only has\r the economy not grown, but it shrank.\r \r    argentina has an extremely low credit rating.  countries are\r internationally classified by their credit, and we are in one of the lowest\r categories.  our commercial credit is also being curtailed.  commercial\r credits are the ones that allow us to import, export, and meet our daily\r needs.\r \r    when the new administration assumed power on 8 april 1989, the central\r bank's foreign reserves were exhausted.  this situation can turn into a\r crisis at any moment.  we cannot continue like this.\r \r    the coming of this new government, which has brought about positive\r expectations and hope, and which is undertaking remarkable changes -- mainly\r changes of mentality -- has stopped the crisis from exploding.  but we\r cannot rest on our achievements.  we must face this problem immediately.\r \r    our starting point in certainly very uncomfortable.  our country has no\r prestige abroad; we have lost our credibility.  no one even wants to hear\r about argentina, or at least about its debt.  in the past few years we have\r not honored any of our commietments.  every time we signed a letter of\r intent with the imf, we knew that we could not comply with it.  there have\r been several letters of intent we did not comply with.\r \r    what policy will we follow in the future?  the president defined it in\r his message to congress on 8 july.  he said we have a heavy burden, a debt\r that was unwisely contracted, but it is a commitment of honor.  he used\r words that were common in argentina in the past.  \r \r    it was once said: we will comply with our commitments, even at the cost\r of hunger and thirst for the argentine people.  the president has made his\r own commitment on this subject.  we will pay according to the capability of\r the nation, and the only thing we require is a bit of time and, of course,\r flexibility on the part of our creditors.\r \r    if we did not honor our commitments, if we had said we are not going to\r pay, the situation in our country would be dramatically worse.  we would be\r isolated.  we would not be able to obtain credits, we would not be able to\r obtain foreign capital investments.  in a word, we would not be able to\r integrate the rest of the world, which is quickly expanding and\r progressing.  we would be much more backward than we are today.  therefore\r there is really no question of paying or not paying.  the honor of the\r country is at stake.\r \r    what is the role of the foreign debt in our economic recovery?  you know\r that we have everything necessary.  we have natural resources, food, energy,\r fishing, mining, etc.  we have human resources.  you know that when\r argentines work abroad they are efficient and they are recognized as such.\r we have no internal religious, racial, or indian problems, not even problems\r with our neighbors.\r \r    what are we missing?  why are we where we are, and why can't we survive?\r we need two things: first, we need an appropriate economic order.  we live\r in a deep economic and social disorder.  second, we need capital.  capital\r is absolutely necessary.\r \r    i said that i was going to discuss the savings in argentina that can be\r tapped.  for years, argentina's savings have been constantly punished by\r government actions, such as abusive taxes, mandatory savings, and, above\r all, the great erosion caused by inflation that destroys the currency.  just\r remember how many times we have changed our currency.  to protect themselves\r from these losses, what did savers do?  they either took their money abroad\r or hid it under their mattresses.  we will focus today on the money under the\r mattresses, although what i will say now will also be relevant for those who\r have their savings abroad.  according to calculations, there are small,\r medium, and large savings adding up to nearly $5 billion in the country.  a\r person was assaulted in cordoba the other day and $250,000 was found in his\r mattress.  money under the mattress is at risk, does not accrue interest,\r does not work for the country, and does not give any benefit to the owners\r nor the country.\r \r    some of our hope lies in these savings inside and outside of the country,\r because they represent a reserve that we have on hand.  we are not\r bankrupt.  we have those reserves, although they are not working.  the\r secret is to use them for the country's benefit.  argentina's problems can\r be resolved if these savings are used.  now, to tap into these savings, the\r government has made a decision, and the central bank has already translated\r it into a resolution.  into banks here in the country in dollars, yen,\r deutsche marks, or any other currency.  they will be able to make\r withdrawals whenever they want in the same currency in which their savings\r were deposited.  nobody will be allowed to touch them.  this will be\r reinforced by a law granting savers the maximum guarantee that no public\r power can intervene in those savings; that is, there will be a financial\r system into which those savings, in any currency, can be placed for the\r benefit of the country and, of course, the depositor.  anybody who has\r $10,000 under his mattress can take it out, go to the bank, and, under the\r guarantee of the bank -- not the central bank or the nation, which have been\r discredited -- the money will be at his disposal at any time.  the bank will\r lend the money for export operations and for moving the country's wealth.\r new blood will thus have been injected into the argentine financial system.\r \r    i point out that the law will give maximum guarantees. no public power\r will have the right to seize the savings, nor freeze them, nor postpone\r their withdrawal.  these are the maximum guarantees that can be given; more\r is impossible.  each argentine must now think about what this means.  it has\r a crucial importance, because it injects blood into the social body; it\r moves the country.  moreover, from the moral standpoint, if we do not do\r this, how can we go abroad and ask foreigners to invest in argentina -- to\r bring their money to argentina -- if at the same time i do not invest here\r because i do not have confidence in my country? this is an immoral position.\r \r    if we make the initial effort and deposit $2, 3 or 4 billion in the\r country, our negotiations abroad take a new twist, because we can say that\r the argentines have made the first effort.  all this naturally depends on\r confidence, and confidence in turn depends on taking this first step.  this\r is a reciprocal effect.  to create confidence, measures such as those\r adopted by the government and the central bank have to be adopted.  these\r measures create confidence, and with confidence the country will quickly\r recover.  we have many other things to say about this, but within the\r limitation of time, we can stop here.", "templates": []}

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0502", "doctext": "according to western diplomats, colombian drug\r traffickers have moved to guatemala in search of new supply routes,\r bringing instability to a country that is experiencing a wave of\r violence from various sectors.\r \r    the diplomats believe that up to 200 colombians linked to the\r medellin and cali cartels are now operating in guatemala and that\r about 500 kg of cocaine pass every week through the country,\r essentially enroute to the u.s. market.\r \r    the increasing drug trafficking activity coincides with a new wave\r of kidnappings, bombings, and murders in guatemala, awakening fears\r that the country will return to the violence prevalent at the\r beginning of the decade, when thousands were killed by death squads\r during military regimes.\r \r    since august, a prominent politician, a well-known banker, and at\r least five university students have been murdered.  several bombs have\r exploded in the capital in recent months and students and human rights\r activists are missing.\r \r    \"all of this violence cannot be blamed on a (words indistinct), but\r the increase of drug trafficking is clearly an additional concern.\"\r \r    in addition to the cocaine, which the diplomats say is taken to the\r united states aboard light planes or in automobiles through mexico and\r texas, u.s. officials have reported an increase in opium production in\r guatemala.  according to estimates, the number of hectares planted\r went from 225 in 1985 to 1,500 this year.\r \r    there are insistent rumors that banker ramiro castillo love was\r murdered outside his house on 25 august because he refused to launder\r drug money.  there is open talk in the capital about important\r politicians being linked to drug trafficking.\r \r    nevertheless, the diplomats say that there is no evidence to back\r such speculation and they add that it is very likely that several\r interests are working to destabilize the country's fragile democracy.\r \r    \"it seems as if several strings are being pulled at the same time,\"\r a diplomat said.\r \r    while christian democratic president vinicio cerezo has given\r guatemala a respite, after decades of military regimes during which it\r is believed that more than 100,000 people were killed as a result of\r political violence, it is estimated that approximately 1,200 leftist\r guerrillas are still fighting in the mountains.\r \r    furthermore, the country has faced two coup attempts since\r democracy was restored in 1986.\r \r    the ultra-right-wing, with its ties to the land-owning oligarchy,\r continues to be a powerful force in the country.  it has blocked a\r majority of reforms that cerezo has tried to introduce and, according\r to the general consensus, it has promoted discontent among the armed\r forces' mid-level officers.\r \r    \"the ultra-right-wing is undoubtedly behind part of the violence,\"\r said a diplomat.  \"it could be trying to force the government to\r overreact or cause the army to get involved.\"\r \r    as if to confirm this, a police arrest warrant has been issued\r against former presidential candidate lionel sisniega, a noted\r politician who leans to the right and has been involved in coup\r attempts since 1954, on charges of heading a group responsible for\r much of the violence in the country.\r \r    diplomats have also pointed to the resurgence of activities by\r left-wing guerrillas who have been struggling to topple successive\r governments over the past 2 decades.\r \r    \"nowadays they are using much more obvious tactics, erecting\r barricades on highways and occupying small towns near the capital,\"\r one diplomat said.\r \r    fear that the violence of the seventies will return may also\r contribute toward a resurgence in the number of illegal immigrants\r that cross over to mexico.\r \r    mexican authorities say that the number of undocumented central\r americans deported to guatemala has doubled over the past few months.\r \r    the diplomats feel that cerezo's government will weather the\r violence and pass it onto his successor after the presidential\r elections scheduled for november 1990.\r \r    \"perhaps the situation is the result of the preparation for\r elections in guatemala,\" a diplomat said.  \"things will probably\r worsen next year.\"",

 one of james brady's advisers\r published an article in the new york times stating that the brady plan\r was announced in september 1985 to prevent the dissemination of the\r peruvian attitude of unilaterally reducing its debt payments.\r \r    who knows if the acapulco and punta del este meetings have not led\r the creditors to acknowledge that the debt is not worth its face value\r and that it must be reduced?\r \r    therefore, there has been progress.  who knows if next year we will\r be speaking of reducing the debt by 50 percent and not just the 20\r percent that we now seek?\r \r    you see, the fact is that not only are we unable to pay and that we\r are negotiating to pay less, but the creditors also know that they\r will not be able to collect their money if they insist on their\r claims.\r \r    therefore, if the united states and the soviet union are heading to\r ward disarmament, why can't there be a financial disarmament between\r the rich and poor?  i think that economic trends will follow this\r line.\r \r    (reporter) president, why hasn't panama been definitively expelled\r from this group, and will the group of eight expand?\r \r    (garcia) panama as a country, independent of its past\r administrations, was a founder member of the group of eight.  no\r country can be expelled.  this is a term that would offend the\r citizenry of a country.  we simply ratified the suspension of panama\r indefinitely until panama is governed by a democratically elected\r government.  that was our decision.\r \r    (reporter) (passage indistinct) the oas?\r \r    (garcia) we are preparing a proposal in which we state that the oas\r is an important forum or mechanism for hemispheric dialogue but which\r must include the presence of cuba and other countries which are yet\r not members.\r \r    (reporter) will the group of eight expand?\r \r    (garcia) i hope so.  this is the last year in which i will attend a\r meeting of the group of eight, which i helped to create.  however, i\r hope this group will lead annual and periodical meetings of all latin\r america presidents.  i have maintained this hope since 1985.  i hope\r that latin america will annually coordinate some kind of collegial\r executive branch to make important decisions.  the group of eight is\r the beginning of this, and i am sure that it will expand in the\r future.\r \r    however, at a continental level, the issues cannot run as fast as\r for a country, a people, or a political process.  a continent requires\r much longer terms and we must be patient.  let us go to another\r subject now.\r \r    (reporter) human rights.  two of the main issues in latin american\r life are democratization and human rights.  president menem has\r recently pardoned military officers and terrorists who were serving\r prison sentences.  there is also a conflictive situation in peru\r regarding some military officers who are being tried for murders\r committed in jails.  are you willing to pardon those military officers\r to pacify the situation?

decisions adopted during the session was to recruit minors, shantytown\r youths, and high school students \"to fight a guerrilla war in chile,\r because they have plenty of motivation.\"\r \r    this policy is outlined in documents and reports that those\r terrorist groups have circulated in shantytowns and among their\r members.  some of those documents and reports have been seized from\r boys who were arrested on charges of being directly involved in\r looting of commercial premises and in the bloody murders of\r carabineros personnel.\r \r    some of those documents say that \"socialist countries are our\r strategic allies,\" and that the movements identify themselves with\r \"the revolutionary form of struggle and with the struggle in the\r trenches that cuba, nicaragua, and el salvador have used\" to remain in\r the forefront of latin american socialism.\r \r    the two terrorist movements maintain that \"seizure\" of land,\r lootings, occupation of educational institutions, and \"the recovery of\r firearms\" are the main tactics to be undertaken by the masses in order\r to \"gain elbow room.\"\r \r    in the documents, the movements advocate the dissemination of\r violence within the masses, the adoption of defensive measures in\r order to begin an offensive, and \"a war by everyone\" as an inevitable\r step for taking over the country.\r \r    the movements maintain that \"the fact that the rebel elements have\r discovered their own geographical zone, the power of the masses, and\r the massive potential of youths, is one of the major achievements of\r the people's movement.\"\r \r    the documents emphasize the terrorist actions performed by the\r manuel rodriguez patriotic front (fpmr) and by the movement of the\r revolutionary left (mir), stressing that the mjl and the frpl are the\r two other chilean extremist organizations that \"implement the policy\r of the victory of the people's revolution.\"\r \r    as for the so-called \"war by everyone,\" the documents points out\r that \"in the chilean version, there are irregular forces with training\r in subversive tactics and strategy.\"\r \r    the movements maintain that their members operate in the streets,\r in education and labor centers, in high schools, and in shantytowns,\r adding that \"the tactical sequence of action among the masses should\r begin and end with popular uprisings, which lead to a higher stage of\r transition toward \"the people in flames\" or \"the people in arms.\"\r \r    the movements admit that \"the art of revolution consists of\r awakening the ambition for power by teaching the masses to dream of\r something else.\"\r \r    another paragraph of the lengthy documents states that: \"we do not\r deny the need to reach political accords\", which we -- as a matter of\r principle --comply with, because \"the objective is to adopt a position\r of independence and of initiative in the offensive, because the\r revolutions are fought in the streets and in the different regions of\r the country.\"\r \r    concerning the creation of the two movements (beginning in 1983),\r the documents state that \"our political-military proposal takes root\r in the \"war by everyone,\" a system which socialist countries and\r triumphant revolutions have used to defend themselves from\r imperialism.  the most intense expression of this policy has been\r reflected by the vietnamese revolution, by the sustained struggle in\r el salvador, and by the resistance to the spanish invasion by the\r mapuche people, under the leadership of lautaro.\r \r how to obtain weapons\r \r    in a document dealing with the \"revoltionary program for chile,\"\r the movements claim that \"our weapons are obtained through the\r people's initiative, through weapon seizures from the enemy (this is a\r clear allusion to the murder of carabineros, whose arms they seize),\r and through international solidarity.\"\r \r    the documents emphasize \"the offensive war which we are now waging\r seeks to asphyxiate the enemy, overwhelm it, and impede its initiative\r and the concentration of its forces.  we should always try to cause as\r much destructive damage to the enemy as possible.\"\r \r    the terrorists call on \"youths to wage this revolutionary struggle\r on a nationwide basis,\" adding that \"even though the heaviest burden\r rests on the cities, the country and rural areas are conducive to the\r installation of strategic facilities.\"\r \r    the report on the first national plenum (which is dated may 1989)\r has been especially dedicated to \"all high school and mid-level\r students who have been recruited by our groups.\"\r \r    among the slogans included in the documents, which the lautaro\r movement members will use this year, are phrases like \"we are a new\r revolutionary generation,\" \"we are happy, we are rebel, we are armed,\r and this is how we will carry out the revolution,\" \"the fatherland for\r the people,\" and \"free love and guerrilla.\"\r \r    after outlining the eight tactical operations which make up \"the\r revolutionary course for the masses who will face the political break\"\r during the rest of the year, the two movements state that \"we total\r approximately 500,000 all over the country, and since 1983 we have\r fought in more than 30 territories and fronts.\"\r \r    finally, as part of a series of clear terrorist instructions, they\r claim that they work \"in coordination with the fpmr and with the\r mir,\"so that \"with the

(changes thought) for\r that purpose we act based on article 167, no.  6, which reads: it is\r up to the council of ministers to suspend and restore the\r constitutional guarantees mentioned in article 29 of this constitution\r if the legislative assembly is not in session.

declare a state of seige as a measure to protect the salvadoran\r people, who are being unjustly attacked by the irrationality and\r savagery of the fmln's terrorism, which the government of the

the true nature of the fmln and how it wants to\r subjugate the salvadoran people.\r \r    they must also listen and condemn daniel ortega for what he has\r been saying these days.  he should be condemned because he has been\r trying to confuse the international community by saying that in el\r salvador the government has been carrying out indiscriminate bombings.\r however, everybody here knows that the fmln has been planting bombs,\r and so far 8 civilians have been killed and more than 100 have been\r wounded as a result of that indiscriminate terrorism.\r \r    it is necessary to condemn ortega and make him responsible for\r sending the weapons used to kill and to bleed the salvadoran people to\r death.  he should no longer be allowed to continue these actions while\r trying to hide them and to deceive the international community.\r \r    it is also time to openly condemn the fmln for its irrational\r actions.  everybody knows that since the 1st day of this\r administration, the government of the republic offered to begin a\r dialogue process.  it offered to solve this problem through rational\r and peaceful means, since that is what the salvadoran people wanted\r and that is what they demanded on 19 march election day.\r \r    we can no longer allow the fmln leaders to travel freely throughout\r the world in an attempt to disinform the international community,\r which instead of falling into the trap of disinformation should\r categorically condemn the fmln's irrational actions (words\r indistinct).\r \r    we are not issuing this call to the diplomatic corps on behalf of\r the salvadoran government.  we are making this call on behalf of the\r salvadoran people, who are subject to the savagery of indiscriminate\r terrorism.  we issue this call because we believe and we are convinced\r that the salvadoran people do not deserve this fate.  the salvadoran\r people do not deserve to be attacked with terrorist bombs. they should\r not be facing the threats the fmln is trying to carry out.  the\r salvadoran people have shown the world during these long 10 years that\r they want peace, democracy, progress, and do not want to live under\r systems that are already obsolete in history, that are no longer\r justified or accepted at this time when the world is evolving toward\r peace and democracy.\r \r    on behalf of the people, we are asking you to condemn the fmln's\r irrational attitude.\r \r    we also want to tell the fmln that the armed forces are supporting\r their people and will never permit terrorist actions to lead to\r anything else but the destruction of that movement that has tainted\r our history.  we want them to know that the way to solve problems in\r el salvador is through reasoning and peaceful means and that the\r government of the republic will continue trying to achieve peace as\r soon as possible and within that framework: through reasoning and\r peaceful means.\r \r    salvadoran people, again we urge you to remain calm. the armed\r forces are controlling the situation.  we will soon live normal lives\r again.  however, at this time we ask all of you to support the peace\r process, to join forces in order to achieve peace.  the fmln should\r feel the people's pressure against its irrational actions.\r \r    we are sure that with you -- the salvadoran people, armed forces,\r and

(words indistinct) and the house where the\r priests lived was surrounded by soldiers.  together with this\r information, gathered by several institutions and prominent persons to\r prove that the murder was carried out by soldiers, we must stress that\r the house was also searched by the soldiers 2 days before the crime\r was committed.  a jesuit priest who was describing the scene said that\r only the area previously searched by the soldiers was destroyed.  he\r said that the library was burned and the rooms had been ransacked.\r according to the priest, $5,000 that father ignacio ellacuria had\r received in barcelona -- part of an award given the university -- were\r taken from one of the rooms.\r \r    the use of long-range weapons would also explain why the brains of\r the dead were scattered about.  this was seen by the first persons who\r arrived on the scene.  others said that the bodies were destroyed\r because ak-47 and m-16 assault rifles were used in the attack.  the\r bodies were so utterly destroyed that embalming was not possible.\r this was reported to acan-efe by society of jesus superior jose maria\r tojeira.\r \r    regarding the two murdered women, the cook elba julia ramos and her\r 15-year-old daughter marisela, all indicates that they were\r machinegunned in the small room where they slept. there was so much\r blood that it seeped under the door, and a vertebra and pieces of a\r skull can still be seen under a sofa in the small room.  the\r preliminary investigations seem to indicate that the victims were not\r tortured as earlier reports had stated.\r \r    meanwhile, salvadoran president alfredo cristiani reportedly said\r yesterday that the armed forces high command has not ruled out the\r possibility that the killers of the six jesuit priests could have been\r soldiers.  they have not ruled out the possibility that soldiers could\r have killed the priests, and they are determined to investigate the\r incident and punish the responsible parties.  this was said by the\r salvadoran president in statements to acan-efe and other foreign news\r agencies.  cristiani, who insisted on the need to avoid unfounded\r conclusions, added that the military does not think it will be\r affected by something done by individual members of the institution.\r \r    we can clearly see now that there are some contradictions.  at this\r moment there are three positions.  there is the position of u.s.\r ambassador william walker -- he is like an ostrich with its head\r buried in the sand.  there is proof that rules out all doubt.  how can\r 40 men in uniform be in a militarized area for 60 minutes and not hear\r shots being fired and bombs exploding?  why did the army not send in\r troops to find out what happened only a few blocks from colonel rene\r emilio ponce's office?  the 40 men were in the area for a whole hour.\r they had already searched father ellacuria's home.\r \r    our question for william walker: if this was not done by the armed\r forces, then why were they there searching the premises for a whole\r hour and even stealing $5,000?  they searched drawer by drawer.  the\r disorder they left behind was quite evident in the clips shown on\r television.  they searched the area for an hour to see what they, the\r murderers, could find to steal.  however, ambassador william walker\r says that he does not know if the army committed the crime.

it has organized the people.  the fmln does not\r forcefully recruit people.  therefore, it is not periodically renewing its\r ranks as the army does through forceful recruitment.  to the fmln, the main\r goal is to organize the people, to get as close as it can to the people.\r \r    because of the economic crisis, social injustice, and lack of democratic\r opportunities in (el) salvador, thousands of salvadorans have no other\r option than to take up arms and fight to achieve better living conditions in\r the face of the government's brutal repression, economic injustice, and\r unemployment.  to change this situation, thousands of salvadorans decided to\r take up arms and learn to wage war by fighting daiily.  that is the history\r of the fmln.\r \r    therefore, it cannot be said that two armies are fighting each other.\r the logistics apparatus of the fascist government' (armed) forces is not\r comparable to our forces.  they bring to our country tons of bombs, rifles,\r boots, and material through ports and military airports.  although the\r governments of nicaragua, cuba, and the ussr could help the fmln, as many\r are saying, the firepower of our forces could never be compared to the\r army's.\r \r    nevertheless, the fmln has opened in all countries, including the\r (united) states, the necessary ways for us to obtain our arms and\r ammunition.  we have the right to this.  how does the fmln learn to fight--\r by fighting.  we are now fighting in cities.  every military analyst knows\r how difficult it is to fight in urban areas.  the fmln fighting in san\r salvador, san miguel, zacatecoluca, and usulutan has shown the\r organization's tremendous ability to wear out the enemy, take and hold\r positions, and maneuver in the city just as it has done in rural areas.  the\r fmln ability has surprised the military analysts at the pentagon.  our front\r has always had this ability.  but now we have changed our strategy and\r tactics to defeat the enemy plans.  the (armed) forces have a specific plan\r regarding the actions by patrols (words indistinct), special operations.\r the fmln had to change its strategy to strike at the small forces that tried\r to infiltrate our zone under cover.  only thus could we annihilate and\r defeat these forces and their strategy.  and this is what we did.  this is\r what must be observed, how the fmln has changed its military strategy to\r face the one used by the (armed) forces.  of course, we have accumulated\r great experience over the years, which we have applied these last days in\r combat in (san) salvador and (san) miguel.  armored personnel carriers are\r being destroyed in streets and avenues;

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0904", "doctext": "regarding the international scandal that the salvadoran government has\r made over an alleged shipment of surface-to-air missiles found inside\r a wrecked light aircraft, the fmln expresses the following:\r \r    1.  in view of a possible intensification of the salvadoran\r conflict, it is necessary to note that the salvadoran armed forces\r were the first ones to escalate the war by launching indiscriminate\r attacks and air bombings against the civilian population in densely\r populated urban areas.  the salvadoran armed forces had been doing\r this for several years in our country's rural areas.  in view of the\r damage that this causes the population, since 1987 the fmln has made\r proposals to scale down the war and suspend the use of aircraft and\r aviation equipment.\r \r    the salvadoran government's charges are hypocritical, as the\r government itself has turned aircraft into real instruments of\r genocide against the salvadoran people.\r \r    2.  the policy of the previous u.s. administration has turned\r central america into a huge arms market whereby thousands of tons of\r soviet and u.s. weapons, including surface-to air missiles, have been\r introduced into the area.  this has created a flourishing black market\r for weapons, where salvadoran and honduran military men and nicaraguan\r contras participate as big-time smugglers.\r \r    3.  the salvadoran government has begun a campaign of accusations\r against the nicaraguan government with the intention of putting up a\r smoke screen to cover the genocide it has unleashed and to divert the\r attention of the international community, which has been demanding:\r \r        a) that the salvadoran government stop the massive and\r indiscriminate attacks in densely populated urban areas and the\r persecution against the political opposition and grass roots\r movements;\r \r        b) an investigation to clear up the murder of six jesuit\r priests and two domestic workers, along with the punishment of those\r responsible for these and similar crimes; and,\r \r        c) that the salvadoran government accept the cease-fire it has\r heretofore rejected and justify its intransigent and irrational\r position.\r \r    4.  cristiani's decision to suspend relations with nicaragua based\r on an alleged shipment of missiles for the fmln is not reasonable, not\r even by saying that this represents an escalation of the salvadoran\r war.  in fact, the u.s. government has escalated the war by sending $4\r billion in aid to strengthen the army and provide it with a powerful\r air force.\r \r    the justification has always been nicaragua's support to the fmln,\r thus refusing to admit the internal causes of the conflict and also\r keeping the doors closed to any negotiations.  this has\r unnecessarily prolonged the salvadoran people's suffering and has       \r made more dramatic their legitimate struggle for a true democratic,\r pluralist, and non-aligned government.\r \r    based on the above, we reiterate:\r \r    1.  that we consider absolutely legitimate our right to obtain all\r types of weapons to guarantee our defense and to protect our people\r from the (word indistinct) military escalation promoted by the\r salvadoran government with the firm support of the previous and\r present u.s. governments.  this includes the right to obtain weapons\r from various sources and to guarantee their arrival at our war fronts\r through any means available.\r \r    2.  we maintain our total willingness to de-escalate the war.  we\r begin by expressing that we are totally willing to agree on a\r cease-fire with international supervision and to begin real\r negotiations to end the war with the participation of all the nation's\r political and social forces.\r \r    3.  we are willing to refrain from using the surface-to-air\r missiles if the air force calls a complete halt to its bombings,\r strafing, and machinegunning throughout the national territory.\r \r    (signed) fmln general command\r \r    commanders joaquin villalobos, shafik jorge handal, eduardo sancho,\r salvador sanchez seren, and francisco jovel\r \r    el salvador, 29 november 1989", "templates": []}

populist new political groups and those of the traditional\r parties received approximately the same number of votes.\r \r    according to unofficial returns released by the private television\r channels, which in previous elections have proven to be very similar\r to those of the national electoral court, carlos palenque, 45, a radio\r and television businessman and the leader of the conscience of the\r fatherland (condepa), has received most of the votes.\r \r    palenque received 39.9 percent of the votes cast in la paz, thereby\r giving condepa 5 of the 13 seats on the town council, which will elect\r the mayor of la paz on 2 january.\r \r    the alliance of the right wing nationalist democratic action (adn)\r and the social democratic movement of the revolutionary left (mir) has\r also won five town council seats.\r \r    ronald maclean, 40 and of scottish ancestry, the mayoral candidate\r of the adn-mir alliance, has obtained 36.8 percent of the votes in la\r paz, where he has been the mayor since l985.\r \r    far behind were the former administration's party, the nationalist\r revolutionary movement (mnr), which received two seats, and the\r populist solidarity civic union (ucs), led by brewery owner max\r fernandez, with one town council seat.\r \r    the decision as to who will be the new la paz mayor on 2 january is\r now in the hands of the mnr, but its leaders declined to comment on\r their position last night.\r \r    gonzalo sanchez de losada, the leader of the mnr, last night said\r on television: \"we must be extremely serious in searching for a\r solution to this problem, or the people will turn their backs on\r populism.\"\r \r    he said his decision will be \"a christmas present.\"  he insisted,\r however, that in his opinion the governing adn-mir alliance \"will\r easily fix things between them\" because \"they are two of a kind.\"\r \r    although the mnr was the party to receive most of the votes in the\r 7 may presidential elections, it was due to an alliance between two\r old political enemies -- the adn and mir -- that jaime paz zamora, who\r had come third in the elections, was installed as president of the\r republic. \"if we applied this same rule to the current problem,\"\r sanchez de losada said jokingly, \"guido capra (mnr candidate for mayor\r of la paz) would be elected.\"\r \r    sanchez de losada pointed out that palenque was one of the\r supporters of the adn-mir governing alliance, which prevented sanchez\r de losada from becoming president.\r \r    according to the opposition, palenque's party gained the la paz\r development corporation (cordepaz) and \"half a ministry\" (referring to\r the communications and transportation ministry) as a result of the\r alliance.  sanchez de losada warned the bolivian politicians that\r palenque's populist group, which is growing very fast, has its eyes\r set \"on the l993 presidential elections, not only on the la paz\r mayorship.\"\r \r    while respect was shown toward ronald maclean, the candidate most\r criticized by the mnr during the municipal elections campaign was\r palenque.\r \r    palenque stated, however, that the councilmen who on 2 january will\r elect the next mayor of la paz must \"respect the will of the\r majority.\"\r \r    \"we hope that there will be no negotiation (among parties) and that\r the desire of the majority will be respected,\" palenque stated.  he is\r well known, especially because of the beard he wears, which makes him\r look very much like former u.s. president abraham lincoln.\r \r    palenque, who is certain of the support he will receive from the\r only ucs councilman in la paz, fears that a pact between the adn-mir\r coalition and the mnr will prevent him from obtaining the mayorship of\r the most important city in the country.\r \r    such an alliance, however, with a greater ideological basis than\r any other, will have to overcome the grudge that the mnr bears because\r the adn and the mir \"had stolen from it\" the presidency of the\r republic during the last elections, according to commentators.\r \r    \"we are going to be very responsible, and we are not going to be\r motivated by personal interests or by any vengeance,\" sanchez de\r losada stated, commenting on the negotiations that will take place to\r designate the mayor of la paz.\r \r    like in la paz, the government alliance will have to negotiate\r support in the other major bolivian cities, where the coalition came\r in first but failed to win absolute majorities.\r \r    the only exception is sucre, where the candidate of the united left\r coalition, radio reporter omar montalvo, obtained 57.3 percent of the\r votes, which is sufficient to obtain the mayorship.\r \r    the most outstanding points about the elections were the abstention\r of between 30 and 50 percent of the voters and the almost absolute\r normalcy during the elections.\r \r    the state of siege decreed throughout the country on 15 november\r due to street confrontations caused by social disturbances did not\r hamper the electoral process.\r \r    the traditional restrictions, however, affected

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1010", "doctext": "the first question we ask\r comrade leo cabral is: what are the results of the offensive after 1\r month?\r \r    (cabral) today, 11 december, after 1 month of a glorious and\r victorious offensive, we have some thoughts regarding this latest\r fight.  we want to stress that all our offensives have centered around\r the main cities in our country.  one of the most important and\r significant achievements of this struggle by the people and the fmln\r is having maintained the besiegement on the most important political\r and economic points, most especially on the country's capital.  there\r has been great pressure in the case of san salvador, and the fmln has\r forced the joint chiefs of staff, colonel ponce, and the fascist high\r command to change their strategic tactics three times.\r \r    you will recall that the joint chiefs of staff first tried to\r dislodge the fmln forces that had entered since the evening of 11\r november.  when the first puppet army strategic defense tactic failed,\r they then tried to isolate the fmln forces from one another and\r annihilate them one by one.  for this, they concentrated special\r forces, especially using elite battalions, in a siege modality for\r annihilation.  this also failed.  faced with the second failure of\r their special tactics to end the offensive in a few days, as cristiani\r and the high military command had said, they moved a great number of\r operational forces from the country's interior, such as the elite\r battalions, to set up an extensive siege to defend the capital city\r and prevent our forces from entering it.  as all our people have been\r able to see -- and international public opinion has also been able to\r verify this through a great amount of information flowing through\r international reporters -- that siege to keep out the fmln has also\r failed.  this means more victories and successes, such as incursions\r into the escalon neighborhood and the southern area of antiguo\r cuscatlan, and two important attacks on the joint chiefs of staff.\r \r    right now we see that the puppet army's special city operation is\r their third and last plan.  they have formed four commands to control\r the city, which will also be defeated by our fmln military forces.  we\r also must add to this list of achievements that the great\r concentration of enemy army operational forces in the capital has\r caused a great national imbalance in forces.  this means that\r extensive areas of the country are without the protection of the\r puppet troops.  we have taken advantage of this and have worked on\r organizing the people and raising a people's power, an alternative to\r local reactionary power.\r \r    we also record as a successful offensive during this first month\r the fact that our enemy's intelligence work has been completely\r smashed.  the searches, which have been entrusted in an improvised\r manner to military troops concentrated in the cities, especially the\r repressive corps, have attempted to restore all the intelligence data\r banks to be able to try and destroy the people's struggle.  we must\r also record as one of the successes of our general offensive during\r this first month the fact that the puppet army was forced to abort\r another plan.  even though there were some bloody events, such as the\r murder of the jesuit priests, along with a great amount of kidnappings\r and missing people and arrests of members or leaders of grassroot\r people's movements, we feel that the army and repressive corps are\r incapable of attending to the fmln offensive and the besiegement at\r the same time that they are trying to carry out their annihilation of\r the people's movement.  so this is another success.

 full diplomatic relations will come into force as soon as the\r protecting powers for the two countries have been informed.  britain's\r interests in argentina have been represented by switzerland since\r 1982.  argentina's interests in london have been represented by brazil\r from the same period.\r \r    talks on fisheries around the falklands will continue.  a working\r group on south

end.  however,\r the newly-elected argentine government made clear last year that such\r hostilities could now be considered at an end.  britain, after talks\r last october, agreed to raise no

popularity decline as argentina inflation has\r remained at a high level.\r \r    britain and argentina will also establish a direct communication\r link between their respective military authorities.  the purpose is to\r reduce the possibility of incidents and to limit their consequences if\r such incidents should occur.  according to the statement, this hotline\r will increase common knowledge of

islanders to decide on their own contacts with the mainland.\"\r \r    asked if the instability in argentina might lead to a new attempt\r to seize the falklands, he said: \"i think that is becoming less and\r less likely.\"  he expressed appreciation that the readiness of the\r government in argentina to make this advance which britain had\r reciprocated.  \"the outcome is very satisfactory,\" he said.  the\r british protection zone had been replaced \"with something from a\r security point of view that is better.  we have replaced it with an\r advance notification system on the approach of

(there is $60 million for\r repression).  barely recuperated from his surprise, the foreign\r minister said that the u.s. help is a \"bilateral issue and,\r consequently, it will not be directly addressed\" at the cartagena\r summit.  the interior minister, who has more experience in this type\r of situation, did not attach much importance to mcafee's statement and\r stressed that \"more exact figures will be mentioned at the cartagena\r summit.\"  who is telling the truth?  will the cartagena summit address\r the economic aid?\r \r    after this peculiar situation, the united states seems to have\r chosen interdiction and eradication -- repression -- to fight drug\r trafficking.  the strategy of \"war against drug trafficking\r terrorists\" has prevailed.  this strategy lends itself to\r interventionist military policies, similar to the presence of u.s.\r marines in bolivia in the past, or, in the future, the creation of a\r multinational military force that would jeopardize regional political\r and military stability.\r \r    when the trafficking of cocaine was carried out as a covert\r operation (1984-87) involving the cia and the u.s. army -- for the\r purpose of providing military supplies to the contras -- cocaine\r trafficking was not a crime.  the links between noriega and drug\r trafficking were a matter of secondary importance as long as he\r provided information and support for their war against nicaragua.  but\r now the united states does not mind invading panama or turning\r colombia into an inferno to capture noriega or some of the major\r colombian traffickers on this crusade against drug trafficking.  that\r is the u.s. government's double-faced morality.\r \r    another scandal hit u.s. society last week.  marion barry, the\r mayor of washington, the capital of the empire and also the capital of\r crime, was caught in an fbi trap.  he was filmed consuming cocaine.\r his followers claim that it is a white conspiracy to prevent a black\r mayor from running for another term.\r \r    but the interesting point for us is the controversy between\r bennett, the u.s. government strategist for the struggle against drug\r trafficking (the bennett plan), and washington police chief fulwood.\r while bennett has questioned the efficiency of the washington police,\r claiming that this area receives the largest amount of federal support\r for the struggle against drug trafficking, fulwood has said that\r bennett is wasting time \"talking without doing absolutely anything\"\r (newsweek, 29 january).  the newsweek journalist said that even before\r the barry scandal it was possible to see that the bennett plan had\r become \"only a dirty battle of words.\"  bennett's strategy for the\r prevention and repression of drug abuse in the united states has been\r a total failure.  bennett therefore believes that the best way to\r cover his failure is to turn toward latin america to relieve the fury\r of his impotence, ordering warships and planes to control maritime and\r air traffic.  as usual, those of us who live in the \"backyard\" have to\r pay for the mistakes of u.s. policy.\r \r    this is not a story of suspense.  the suspense has been created by\r the attitude of the government.  the country needs to know the\r conclusions of the santa cruz summit.  otherwise we will have to\r accept that a smoke screen has been deployed over the cartagena\r summit.", "templates": []}

(a lawsuit\r filed with the 14th criminal court of santiago under \"robbery of\r industrial secrets\" charges claims that the bombs were built with\r plans stolen from carlos cardoen by one of cardoen's trusted men.)\r \r    to export its bombs, ferrimar needed the authorization of the\r defense and foreign ministries. the company had to provide what is\r known in the international weapons market is known as an \"end-user\r certificate\" or \"final-user certificate.\" ferrimar got one. it was\r signed in august 1985 by a nigerian army officer who, according to\r sources close to the case, had retired a long time ago. a \"triangle\r operation\" was carried out to conceal the true operation. it is not\r known whether the defense ministry has indicted anyone over the\r deception by which it was victimized.\r \r    at the end of january 1986, the first 100 bombs were shipped by\r plane to bandar abbas airport in iran. each bomb weighed 227 kg and\r contained 248 ammunition packages, some of them for immediate\r discharge and others for delayed action.  these were capable of mining\r large areas for up to 72 hours after a battle.\r \r    the first shipment was worth $7 million; $1 million was for\r stroiazzo and $1.5 million went for the cost of the bombs. the price\r of the bombs abroad was $14,000 each, but their real cost was only\r $3,000. the chilean contact in this operation, fernando perez, was to\r have received $4.5 million.\r \r    a test was performed in iran and the bombs did not work. the\r iranian defense ministry asked that new tests be carried out in chile.\r (continued)", "templates": []}

 after all, a radical solution of the drug\r problem primarily demands neither combat aircraft not armored\r personnel carriers, but something quite different.  it is necessary to\r change the economic profile of vast provinces where the cultivation of\r coca and marijuana is the sole source of the population's existence.\r \r    true enough, the united states has now expressed readiness to\r assist also in this sphere.  on the other hand, there is an almost\r total lack of readiness to import from south america the crops which\r could, in principle, squeeze out coca and marijuana.  it was not for\r nothing that colombia's president virgilio barco, the white house's\r closest ally in the struggle against drugs, was forced to declare in\r cartagena that the u.s. government's rigid protectionist measures are\r jeopardizing the very future of \"alternative\" sectors of tropical crop\r farming -- the cultivation of coffee, flowers, and sugar cane.  and so\r the \"senior partner\" appears to be tightening with the one hand the\r vise in which the drug mafia now finds itself, while using the other\r hand to protect its market from legal latin american exports.\r \r    finally, the last but, i think, most substantive argument.\r actually, it also casts an unfavorable light on the role of consistent\r fighter against the drug mafia which washington has now assumed.  this\r argument is perfectly encapsulated in just one short word: \"panama.\"\r indeed, did the recent aggression against this sovereign state, one of\r whose main motives was actually \"to punish the drug business bosses,\"\r not demonstrate all the flaws of washington's \"strongarm approach\"\r toward latin america?  and are there any guarantees that the pentagon\r will not start \"copying\" its panamanian experience in other countries\r in the continent on the pretext of pursuing the \"cocaine barons\"?\r \r    these are far from rhetorical questions, and it is a pity that\r cartagena simply failed to provide even the slightest clear-cut\r answers to them.", "templates": [{"incident_type": "bombing", "Location": [[["colombia", 18], ["cartagena", 36]]], "PerpInd": [[["terrorists", 1324]]], "PerpOrg": [], "PhysicalTarget": [[["stores", 1362]], [["marinas", 1380]]], "Weapon": [[["bombs", 1307]]], "HumTargetCivilian": [], "HumTargetGovOfficial": [], "HumTargetMilitary": [], "HumTargetPoliticalFigure": [], "HumTargetLegal": [], "HumTargetOthers": [], "KIASingle": [], "KIAPlural": [], "KIAMultiple": [], "WIASingle": [], "WIAPlural": [], "WIAMultiple": []}]}

(end recording)\r \r    only hours after the president made these statements, the u.s.\r embassy in guatemala issued a communique stating that if the united\r states abstained from voicing its concern over human rights abuses, it\r would indeed be acting as an accomplice.  the communique cites\r statements made on 5 march in washington by state department\r spokeswoman margaret tutwiller that u.s. ambassador strook, in his\r capacity as president bush's personal representative, has on many\r occasions told top guatemalan officials, in public and private, that\r those who commit violent acts must be turned over to justice.\r \r    strook is currently in washington where he was recalled by the\r state department for consultations.  according to the diplomatic\r mission, the ambassador's statements accurately reflect the permanent\r u.s. position of considering human rights as an issue that must be\r treated at an international level.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1250", "doctext": "everybody is praising and justifying the argentine condor ii\r project -- the only one we had -- now that it has officially died,\r however, a more technical description of the defunct project will\r reveal the gap left by our flimsy space project.\r \r    according to the type of fuel used, missiles are classified as\r solid, liquid, and cryogenic-fueled missiles.  the solid-fueled\r missiles carry their fuel (that burns) and the comburent (that\r supplies the oxygen to trigger the combustion) on a sticky rod, the\r combustion of which cannot be regulated.  the cake burns completely\r once the combustion starts.  therefore, solid-fueled missiles are\r difficult to control although they are much simpler and cheaper.\r moreover, they put up with rough handling and can be easily fired.\r the military prefer this type for manufacturing short-range missiles.\r \r    the liquid-fueled missiles carry the fuel and the comburent in\r completely separate tanks.  the two elements meet in a combustion\r chamber where they ignite after travelling through pipes.  valves make\r it possible to regulate the power of the engine.  ground personnel are\r able to stop the engine and restart it in full flight, in short, to\r control the missile as they wish through radio messages.\r \r    the cryogenic-fueled missiles were developed during the 70's and\r 80's.  they carry hydrogen and liquid gas which are lighter than any\r other propellant element but which are very expensive to refrigerate\r and to isolate.  this technology makes it possible to build very fast\r vehicles because of their power to weight ratio.\r \r    they are used to place huge communication satellites in space some\r 36,000 km above the equator, or to attack a city from the other side\r of the world.\r \r    liquid-fueled missiles represent the technology developed during\r the 50's and 60's and, to a certain extent, explains soviet leadership\r in space research.  these old, heavy, cumbersome, and unbreakable\r missiles do not have fragile equipment and make it possible to place\r cargo into outer space at a reasonable cost.  on the other hand, the\r large family of u.s. and european cryogenic- fueled missiles continue\r at an experimental stage and are unpredictable (as the case of the\r space shuttle and the ariane iv and v).  moreover, they are incredibly\r costly.\r \r    too poor to even think of developing liquid-fueled missiles, brazil\r and argentina have tried to place solid-fueled vehicles into orbit for\r decades.  this is not all that easy because these missiles are really\r little more than flying rods (canitas voladoras), but the castor,\r which was developed by argentina in 1978, the sonda iv developed by\r brazil, and the japanese launching devices developed by isas (a\r university space research agency) have proved to be reasonably\r manageable beasts.\r \r    the castor represented the phase previous to designing a spaceship\r and this must be the reason why it mysteriously died in 1978 after a\r series of incredibly successful tests and after having allowed us to\r reach an agreement for a \"joint-venture\" with the frg to study the\r atmosphere.  the absence of mistakes by a debtor country may be fatal.\r \r    when argentina once again started to discreetly think about outer\r space (1982/83), it already had enough knowledge to consider larger\r projects.  in fact, with its one meter diameter tube, the condor could\r place a 200 kg cargo in a low polar orbit of only 200 km.\r \r    this project would have allowed argentina to have one or more pairs\r of eyes in space so that could assess its natural resources, predict\r the water flow of rivers on which hydroelectric dams could be built,\r determine where it could find oil and uranium, and cheaply stop\r illegal fishing on the continental platform.  this possibility could\r not be accepted by some people.\r \r    brazil, which is less hard up, is about to progress from the sonda\r iv to the sonda v and has openly invited us to jointly develop the\r spaceship.  what will argentina answer?  \"we will\"?  or will it have a\r chauvinist attitude?  what a pity it did not adopt that attitude now\r that it is letting the condor project die in its first stage -- it was\r never tested -- when the pressure is not as great as it has been.\r worst of it all is that it is not receiving anything in exchange.\r \r    very well then, it is accepted, the condor will go no further.\r what is left?  very little.  should we develop satellites exclusively\r for space research to discover the secrets of the sun, or study the\r cosmic explosions of x-rays.  these issues, if unaffected by economic\r and political factors, do not disturb anybody.  the nasa is quite\r willing to give us room, free of charge, on their rockets for this\r type of satellites.  there is no possibility that we will gain either\r money or space sovereignty.  there is no need to point out that any\r similarity between this possibility and an independent space research\r program, such as brazil's, is mere coincidence.\r \r    in the 80's argentina allowed its nuclear program, which at that\r time was the most advanced in the third world, to be hindered.  now it\r is allowing its wings to be clipped and, with a stupid smile, is\r yielding every attempt to achieve sovereignty in space.  each attempt\r to develop technology is labelled arms escalation by those champions\r of peace, our creditors.\r \r    it is quite true, the condor ii may be a missile, as a cargo\r aircraft may drop bombs and a truck may be equipped with artillery for\r war.  does this mean that argentina must stop manufacturing all type\r of vehicles?  this question is not pointless in a country that refuses\r to make any progress.", "templates": []}

concerning that situation, i have said that several\r people have made statements, not just one.  there has been public\r speculation as to what may have happened in the assassinations of the\r jesuit

should go to the judge to give him the information.  he should not\r continue to speculate in public, because it confuses people and it\r obstructs the judicial process.\r \r    i would like to mention, for example, that not long ago a\r delegation of spanish legal experts visited the country and they were\r pleased to see how the 4th criminal judge was handling the judicial\r process, as opposed to other reports that have been released in the\r united states.  however, i believe that no one should speculate in\r public as to what may have happened.  if someone has information or\r evidence, he should go to the judge, otherwise there will be\r confusion.  in that regard, i believe that the armed forces\r commanders' rejection of col. ochoa's statements is just that.  in\r many of the statements they wrote -- i did not participate in drafting\r the statement -- they mentioned that they are willing to support and\r strengthen the judicial process, but they cannot come out in

neither man was identified by name in the report.  according to\r federal agents, the cocaine paste was brought from bolivia by\r fishermen and canoers hired on the brazilian- bolivian border, and was\r processed and distributed in aquidauana.\r \r    o globo terms the raid a \"real clean-up\" in the civilian, military,\r and federal police departments.  the first such action was taken in\r late 1989 when federal police arrested 22 policemen.  o globo of 2\r april cites the arrest of six military policemen caught in the act of\r distributing cocaine in campo grande, mato grosso do sul state, adding\r that the ring included more than 20 military policemen.  the\r ringleader was oldiney freire, an attorney arrested in march 1989 and\r a close associate of rancher cambaralamaia de sousa.  prior to his\r arrest in june 1988, cambaralamaia controlled cocaine trafficking in a\r large portion of mato grosso using the cochabamba, bolivia route.  he\r also supplied 300 kilos of pure cocaine monthly to sao paulo, rio de\r janeiro, and espirito santo.\r \r    rio de janeiro daily jornal do brasil notes on 17 april that the\r federal police department (dpf) is investigating charges that federal\r police are involved in drug smuggling and trafficking in corumba and\r ladario.  trafficking in the region has increased steadily in recent\r years due to the proximity to bolivian towns included in the route\r used by international trafficking rings, according to the paper.\r acknowledging that there have been serious problems with the federal\r police in mato grosso do sul, dpf legal coordinator mario cassiano\r dutra said that in february alone, four investigations were opened\r into charges of police involvement in drug and arms trafficking and\r bribery, an additional 12 were currently in progress, and another five\r only needed documents in order to be concluded.\r \r    to combat the growing narcotics problem in the state capital of\r corumba, on 11 april local station radio clube de corumba launched an\r antidrug campaign.  it devoted an hour of its regular program \"public\r debate\" to an expose of drug distribution points in the city and the\r complicity of federal police, military police, and civilian police\r investigators with narcotraffickers.  according to o globo of 12\r april, program moderator armando amorim anache identified 21 cocaine\r distribution points as well as policemen and the traffickers who\r supplied them in exchange for protection.\r \r    after the program, anache received four threatening phone calls,\r including a bomb threat against the building housing the radio\r station, o globo of 14 april reports.  he received widespread public\r support when he broadcast those threats. radio clube received letters\r alerting police to the use of children who pick up drugs from bolivian\r women at the railroad station.  a mothers' protest parade was planned,\r and 850 local businessmen resolved to close their doors for one day as\r a symbolic protest against the trafficking situation in corumba.  on\r 18 april, the station received six bomb threats from cocaine\r traffickers who also threatened to bomb its sister station radio\r independente de aquidauana, o globo of 19 april reports.\r \r    wearing a yellow t-shirt with the slogan \"drugs: out of here,\"\r president fernando collor de mello launched an antidrug campaign, o\r estado de sao paulo of 29 april reported in a front-page photo with\r accompanying inside-page article.  collor then donated the t-shirt to\r the federal police for an auction to raise funds for equipment,\r particularly for monitoring the border areas.  the mothers of corumba\r are conducting that auction, in which the minimum bid will be 100,000\r cruzeiros.  collor is seeking the participation of the entire society.\r he is not interested in just a health ministry sponsored program, o\r estado reports.", "templates": []}

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1297", "doctext": "chilean president patricio aylwin will today report on the first 70\r days of his administration and will make important announcements\r concerning his future plans in a speech to a plenary meeting of the\r chilean congress that will mark the beginning of special congressional\r sessions.\r \r    aylwin's speech awakens considerable expectation because of recent\r unpublicized clashes between aylwin's administration and general\r august pinochet, who has been throwing his weight around as commander\r in chief of the army, and also because of the growing rightwing\r opposition to the actions of the democratic administration.\r \r    political analysts have pointed out that the presidential speech\r will coincide with the \"end of a government-opposition honeymoon\" that\r had marked the initial weeks of the new administration.\r \r    the administration's initiatives regarding human rights, tax\r reform, the democratization of local governments, and other steps\r aimed at depriving military courts of their powers have worsened the\r conflict and have made things more difficult for aylwin's\r administration.\r \r    this is happening because, while the rightwing parties are leaning\r more and more toward pinochet every day and longing for his\r authoritarian regime, the leftwing parties and even sectors of the\r coalition of parties for democracy have been criticizing aylwin for\r alleged \"lukewarm\" approach to the implementation of the democratic\r changes that he promised during his electoral campaign.\r \r    the rightwing has taken due advantage of several unsolved terrorist\r attacks over the recent weeks to prop up its opposition in congress to\r bills related to human rights.\r \r    however, according to recent opinion polls, aylwin will make his\r speech amid growing popularity, much higher than the support he\r obtained at the 14 december elections.\r \r    the presidential speech to congress at the legislative palace in\r valparaiso, 125 km west of santiago, will mark the return to a long-standing\r democratic tradition that chileans used to enjoy every 21 may.\r \r    on this day, the report to congress was yet another reason for\r popular rejoicing because it coincided with the \"naval glories day\"\r which is also commemorated on 21 may in memory of the chile's top\r naval hero arturo prat who died in the naval battle of iquique during\r the 1879 pacific war.\r \r    since congress was closed down during the military regime, general\r augusto pinochet used to read his state of the nation address on 11\r september, the anniversary of the military coup d'etat through which\r he seized power.\r \r    according to political analysts, aylwin's speech may provide the\r key to the layout of chile's transition in the future.  the manner in\r which the president will make his report is rather curious because\r theoretically this report should encompass one year of government,\r while aylwin has been president for only 70 days during which the\r administration has been harshly criticized by the rightwing every time\r the administration had something bad to say about the prior military\r regime.\r \r    general pinochet personally told aylwin that he felt offended by\r aylwin's labor day celebration speech on 1 may.\r \r    during his latest private meeting with the president, pinochet told\r aylwin that he felt that the \"truth and reconciliation\" commission\r that aylwin had created to investigate human rights violations during\r the military regime was a direct attack on the army.\r \r    pinochet also told aylwin that by way of \"protest\" against these\r actions he would not attend the luncheon to which the president had\r invited all the commanders of the armed forces branches.\r \r    according to leaks about this meeting, aylwin told pinochet: \"watch\r your step, general\" and reminded him that offensive behavior against\r the president could harm pinochet's image even within his own\r institution, the army.\r \r    pinochet did not attend the luncheon, however, sending instead\r general hugo salas, the third highest-ranking army officer and the\r former chief of the cni (national information center), the secret\r police of his regime.\r \r    pinochet failed in his attempt to convoke the national security\r council and to make this council issue a statement against the \"truth\r and reconciliation\" commission, but pinochet's sortie in the political\r arena awoke concern laced with fear, as one government official\r admitted to efe.  the source, who asked to remain anonymous, added\r that \"pinochet is aware of the fear he awakens and he uses it\r adroitly.\"\r \r    the former president will not attend the today's ceremony in\r congress although the commanders of the other armed forces branches,\r the very same ones that did not support his attempt to convoke the\r national security council, will be present.\r \r    pinochet claimed that he has \"institutional reasons\" for his\r absence and has left for northern chile where he is currently touring\r army garrisons.\r \r    analysts believe that the \"pinochet effect\" will be noticeable in\r aylwin's speech through greater moderation in announcements of new\r institutional changes and through more benign assessments of the\r previous military regime.", "templates": []}
